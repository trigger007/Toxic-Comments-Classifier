This seems unbalanced.  whatever I have said about Mathsci, he has said far more extreme and unpleasant things about me (not to mention others), and with much greater frequency.  I'm more than happy to reign myself in, if that's what you'd like (ruth be told, I was just trying to get Mathsci to pay attention and stop being uncivil).  I would expect you to issue the same request to Mathsci.  

 If this is intentionally unbalanced (for whatever reason), please let me know, and I will voluntarily close this account and move on to other things.  I like wikipedia, and I have a lot to contribute in my own way, but there is no point contributing to the project if some editors have administrative leave to be aggressively rude.  I'm a good editor, and I don't really deserve to have people riding my ass every time I try to do certain things.

Considering the controversy about the definition of Druz as Arabs, we'd better of say """"Arab and Arabic speaking people that are not Jewish"""". The Druz may or may not be Arabs, but they definitely speak Arabic.
Some of the 150,000 Palestinian Arabs who became Israeli citizens in 1952 were refugees who managed to return to their homes before the borders closed. By the way, I wonder if we should write """"Palestinian and Bedouin Arabs"""", as the Bedouins often distinguish themselves from the Palestinians.
""""Occupied East Jerusalem"""" - let us do without the complicated discussion about the legal status of Jerusalem. Saying that East Jerusalem was unilaterlly annexed is quite enough in terms of supplying required information.
It is improtant to emphasize the special status of the Druze.
It is important to emphasize the special status of Jerusalemite Arabs.
The regard of Israeli Arabs as an indiginous minority is a theory or a claim. It is not a fact. It is very hard to determine which of the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine is an immigrant from other parts of the Middle East, or a descendant of such an immigrant, and which of them is actually indigenous. This way or another, the conflict between Israel and its Arab citizens cannot be said to be the mere result of a universal phenomenon of tension between indigenous people and newly established authorities. The main cause of tension is the Israeli Arab conflict.

 Please help regarding diacritics in Indian mythological names 

Can you please help me regarding the use of diacritics in Indian mythological names used in articles? I am trying to find a policy page (if it exists) on the usage of names that have diacritics in other articles. Some articles include the diacritic information when   non-English words are used while others don't mention them. This sometimes leads to incorrect pronunciation. For eg: in this article Vishvamitra, """"Puthrakameshti"""" is mentioned in the section """"Kaushika"""". In """"Puthrakameshti"""" the first """"a"""" is short while the second """"a"""" is long thereby requiring a diacritic. As you can see, the diacritic is not used in any part of this article. But in this article Valmiki it is used, """"kāṇḍas"""". Do you know if a policy page exists on this? 

What is a nice balance between making it simple and following proper pronunciation? If I include diacritics on every previously unspecified non-English (in this case, mainly Sanskrit) word it would become difficult to read the article. The other extreme is also not very desirable.

Greetings & question
Hi, Oda Mari. Long time no see. I hope all is well with you and that you're having fun editing. I've stopped editing here and moved over to a Japanese film-specific wiki. (There are several reasons for my departure. The main one is that I believe, Wikipedia's """"notability"""" criteria makes all non-English, non-mainstream film articles easy targets for deletion, unless they have been extensively written about in English.) Unfortunately, so far, the editors only consist of a native English-speaker (myself), and (I believe) a native Czech-speaker. So, with no native Japanese-speaker, we sometimes have to wrestle with the Japanese language a bit ;-) A question has come up at:

If an Ori ship is piloted via a control chair like Ancient tech is does that mean that priors have the Ancient gene, meaning that O'Neill or someone else with the gene could fly it or is it only pilotable by people with powers of a prior?

 

There are many genes to choose from, and it is highly unlikely that the Ori chose the same one as (or one directly compatible with) the Alterans. The priors are tampered with so much, and they have telekinetic and other mental abilities, and piloting probably requires a number of those powers.

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis and the Unbroken Continuity of Sinn Féin Poblachtach since 1905 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necess",0

 I know as I have not been able to find out how many amps the receiver and transmitter drew is what happened on the flight to Hawaii. We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess"""" (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much """"gain"""" they would have gotten from a """"less than optimum"""" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier"""" or 'feeble and unintelligible"""" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.

The bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. """,0

 Taiwan viral marketing scandal 

The idea is to have a summary version of what should be covered more extensively on the Samsung Electronics page.
I have supplied two reliable sources in English, but the summaries I provided of those have been altered in a manner that deprives the reader of important information, so there is a need to discuss that. 
Further, the quote, """"it had not interfered with any online product evaluation report and had stopped online marketing campaigns involving posting or responding to messages in online forums"""" is not a quote from Samsung but a quote from the source indirectly reciting what Samsung said on its Facebook page without quoting Samsung. So it is misleading in its present form, as it appears to be a quote from Samsung. The other source, meanwhile, does directly quote (in quotation marks) a portion of the statement made by Smasung on its Facebook page. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

Now this is the kind of approach to discussion I like. What we need to do is find a way to keep track of all these issues, discuss them (separately or in clusters  whatever works best in various cases), then figure out how to implement what we decide, etc. Now, I really have to get to work now (sometimes I go to work in the middle of the night  quieter, no distractions) but let me quickly suggest the following. Would you mind if, later, I reorder these to bring related issues together, maybe group them into headings, and number them? Then it can be a kind of master checklist while we open separate discussion threads on each issue or cluster, referring to them by number, etc. As new issues come up we can add them under the appropriate heading in the list, and come back to it later if need be. Also, if we get stuck on something (e.g. """"Need to get book X at library"""" or """"EEng and CG decided to take a break on this one before they kill each other"""") we can just note that in the list as the status for that issue, and switch to another issues for a while. Would that be OK?

0b165323e047125b,"""=Where the analogy holds===

In Canadian law, a secure electronic signature can be used (most) everywhere a notarized signature or Minister's signature is required. In other words, this specific form of electronic signature is considered as strong as the strongest form of """"ink-and-paper"""" signature. (The PIPEDA S-E-S regulations can only be satisfied with digital signatures.)

Why do we care? Because there are places where the analogy isn't an analogy, it's a homology: Present a notarized signature on a paper document and a secure electronic signature on the homologous electronic document to a Canadian judge and the judge will likely conclude that for legal purposes they are they same signatures and the same documents. Neither has any greater or lesser standing that the other.

And this needs to be borne in mind when this page is rewritten, especially when the section on legality is rewritten.

Think of it this way: For anyone other than an autograph hound, a signature is of interest for its legal value. Ultimately, the same is true of digital signatures. The technology may be interesting, but, ultimately, the reason we want to get the technology (and procedures and policy) right is so that these things stand up in a court of law.

Perhaps the page needs to be broken into two overall sections: Technology (just the facts) and legality (with no overall content but references to various jurisdictions.

Alternatively, remove any subjective or legal content, and make reference to appropriate pages.

For example, repudiation is not a fact, it is a legal matter.

That's an interesting point actually. I'm not totally sure of the answers, but what I do know is that yes the dip can get sequestered into the fat in the wool of the animals, as farmers are advised to wash carefully after handling newly-dipped sheep for a few days afterwards. However, after a few days that risk is known to be diminished so presumably it moves back out of the wool and is washed away by rain, general rough and tumble. 

Another thing is that the type of thing organophosphates give rise to in humans are neurological... fatigue, dizziness... possibly it does have some effects on the sheep, but it would be difficult to tell. 

The sheep aren't prevented from ingesting it, but the design of sheep dipping baths is such that there isn't a great opportunity for ingesting the dip. They are only totally immersed for about 2 seconds. There's a bar below head level that they need to duck under to move on and out of the bath.

I'd like to issue a public thank you to the Wikipedia community for their attention to this area.  This article has defiantly shown an improvement and is closer to scientifically accurate after my posts.  It is a big responsibility that Wikipedia has, and that responsibility should be free of cultural bias, even if it may seem to go against what we have been led to believe by American media and culture.

When I first started looking into this topic, the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased.  I still feel that objectively, the definition should clearly state that most cross-breeds lead to a reduction in fitness.  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as line-breeding but it is a wasteful effort.  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation, most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool.  99% of mutations are deleterious.

Respect of natural selection should be the default position.  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished, what makes us different is what makes us special.  By mixing the races, in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution.",0

This is clearly discrimination.

then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column.
But it isn't at all what happened.
My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users.
They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside.
You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case.
As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for.

No control for mass was done in either experiment, and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so, if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing, is microwaving the interior of a cone, and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171",0

Since then, Suri has become much more notable in her own right as a toddler fashion icon, with over 13 million hits on google image search.  After getting an administrator to lift the protection on the redirect, I recently restored the article as a stub, but an editor who believes that """"6 year olds are not inherently notable"""" has again requested deletion.

If it's not too much trouble, I'd appreciate your making your opinion known at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suri Cruise (2nd nomination)    """,0

 Vijnana, Bhairava,and Tantra 

Bhairava

Here, Supreme Reality (or Parama Shiva) is termed as Bhairava, which also means the 'Ego Destroyer'. The Word Bhairava is made of three letters bha, ra, and va. According to the hermeneutic etmyology, 'Bha' indicates bharana - maintenance of universe; 'ra' indicates ravana - withdrawal of the universe; 'va' indicates vamana - manifestation of the universe. Thus Bhairava brings together all the three aspects of GOD, shrsti (manifestation), sthiti (maintenance), and laya (withdrawal)",0

There's a lot to learn when you first start editing Wikipedia, and it can be overwhelming to try to learn it all at once. It may be good to look at some high quality artistic biographies on Wikipedia, such as Bronwyn Bancroft or Dave Stamper to see how those articles do things. 
I've cleaned up your draft a lot. If you click """"View history"""" on the page, you can see the various changes that I made. For instance, with this edit I added several wikilinks. With this edit, I created an introductory sentence, so the reader can know instantly who she is and why she is important.
This next edit is very important: in it I changed the references to use  tags, so that individual statements are sourced. Notice how the first time I cite a source, I use the format url.com. When I later want to use the same reference, I only use the format . If you add more statements from these or other sources, you can reference them in the same way.
I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well. But it should only need another sentence or two before you move it into article-space, at Anneliese von Oettingen. I can help with that too, if you like. All the best, –  (talk)

 Original author and valid reference 

Hi. I responsible for the making of the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), and I also freely gave them away to WIkipedia commons.

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?

According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and other contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text, see below!! 

 Wallin H. 2008, 129 p: An investigation of friction graphs ranking ability regarding the galling phenomenon in dry SOFS contact  (Adhesive material transfer and friction), A free pdf document available here or www.diva-portal.org found here or at www.uppsok.libris.kb.se here use search words:""""galling & Harald Wallin"""" or the direct libris link here

I will reinstate my reference in the galling article and I may do so by the Wikipedia’s original means of existence and also formal rules of engagement

be803808d7b52d5a,"(ec with Marskell) Ottava, You seem to be very upset about this, and I am really clueless as to why (and why you hold this position about NPOV and consensus). Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?  Or perhaps it would be useful to post at WT:NPOV to see whether there is consensus for your view that NPOV is decided solely by consensus.  Please let me know if you initiate a discussion, as I would like to participate.",0

Claims that the film misquotes Charles Darwin
Hi lovbebirds, I have a question.  Should we come up with a better title for this section since it is not a claim but a fact?  And it's not a fact that anyone could argue, it's pretty black and white.  The film quote mines Darwin to portray something completely different than what Darwin actually said and meant.  Just curious if calling the fact he quotes mined Darwin a """"claim"""" makes sense?  The film does in fact quote mine Darwin.    """,0

So all the sources on here saying that Ukip are centre right are wrong then. Your assumption that Ukip are right wing automatically means you are calling me right wing. I am not, my political spectrum is centralist, I do not agree with right wing party ideologies. Why would I join one? You are calling me right wing, so you will be waiting a while for your apology, when Ukip are represented in a true light and not by left leaning sources. You will get one. Next you will be telling me all the ex Labour , lib dems etc are right wing, even Reuters call us centre right: http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/08/ukip-replacing-the-lib-dems-or-taking-on-the-tories/

Or that Lord Stodart was once Labour and former councillors that were formerly Labour such as Derrick Huckfield (Staffordshire CC). 

Ukip are centre right.

Once again I will apologise when you with draw the remark that I am right wing, this is asserted by calling my party right wing. (",0

 Nude beach & controversy 

In using the terms I have used in writing and revising this part of this article, I have sought to improve the article for the widest reading audience. I do believe the words I chose when writing this part do serve that end better than some of the changes another keeps making. All opinions are of equal value in Wikipedia, including this part of the article about a legal controversy, even if I feel that I bring to the table both an English degree and a Juris Doctor.

I have learned in my experience that some legal terms (e.g., """"upheld"""" being misunderstood understood to mean """"held up,” rather than being more correctly understood  as an action more akin to """"approving"""" a lower court’s decision) can be confusing to all levels of readers,  intelligent well-educated  readers and average readers alike.

If it is two trolls ping-ponging, its a troll thread, best thing now is delete the whole thread.  If it is two trolls ping ponging, then, its a troll thread, and definitely the best thing is to delete the whole thread.
So it matters not - the best thing is to delete the whole thread - though it is probably too late now.  The troll that started it with his fake appology has got his kicks now, and the other potential trolls out there have had plenty of time to discover it and be inspired to try their own variation.
I suppose, thinking logically from your point of view, there is a third possibility.  It could be a ping-ponging troll that wants it deleted for some weird troll purpose, or two trolls, one of which wants it deleted for some weird troll purpose.  But what could that purpose be?  Trolls feed on exposure, not by invisibility.  If other trolls don't see the thread, or see it promptly removed, they loose their inspiration.
So, please, delete the damm thread.  Can't do any harm.  Either way makes no difference to me personally.

CBDunkerson,
I hope this comment on my own talk page is not considered intervention. (I see I've been unblocked.)

I did not mean to suggest that MONGO was purposely inserting information as part of his job. The only reason I said """"I would not be surprised"""", is because this has been going on for a while now and Wikipedia has not stopped it. What else am I to think? (Although I admit to not being familiar with Wikipedia's procedures.) Still, that comment by me is nothing compared to what MONGO's been getting away with.

(Also just noticed this btw.)

Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV which is why MONGO should steer clear of the 9/11 pages.

An examination of the exchanges between MONGO and myself here is a good example:

MONGO seems content with personal attacks: """"who cares how many misguided folks there are"""".

His comments are clearly ad hominem personal attacks towards me, and many others.

The following, from this page, shows he's content with namecalling as well. I removed an external link to a namecalling site, MONGO reverts me leaving the following statement: I like this weblink...it summaries things quite well

I apologize for any insinuations on my part, but also must stress my own attempts at a NPOV.

I'm sure we all agree, from MONGO's own statements here that he is neither apologetic nor neutral:

""""The POV pushers that try to add nonsense to the articles related to the 9/11 events have been told repeatedly that the vast majority of their """"contributions"""" to those article violated numerous policies. This doesn't seem to stop them. This editor I blocked routinely reverts those that support the concensus verison and yes, conspiracy theorists is what they are...they are not researchers. Simply put, and I won't apologize for this not being more civil, I will continue to block POV pushers that disrupt the discussion pages and the articles with nonsense. Two other admins responded to the unblock request and did not unblock this editor. I then moved the early parts of this conversation from an article talk page to here for all to see. It is ludicrus to assume that I was doing anything other than to ensure that the POV pushers of nonsense know that there is a limit to the level of disruption that needs to be tolerated.""""

""""Self-hating Jew"""" is with very rare exception used as an epithet only. It is very rarely used to legitimately describe an actual condition. I can cite thousands of instances of its use as an epithet; I suspect that one would be hard-pressed to come up with even a dozen examples of its legitimate use. Jfdwolff changed the introduction to include the word """"epithet,"""" so maybe NPOV is not what you think it is in this case.
I understand that there is a history of Jews hiding or otherwise denying or betraying their ethnicity/religion. But """"self-hating Jew"""" is hardly a sympathetic term to describe such a person. Even by Prof. Gilman's position as given in the article, the term arose out of a dispute between different Jewish groups: an epithet. If you met someone who was genuinely distressed about his Jewish identity to the point that he tried to hide or deny it, would you call him a self-hating Jew? I think that would be very cruel; something worse even than calling a handicapped person a """"cripple.""""
I also believe that most reasonable people would agree that your revert was belligerent and blind, given complete information. And I think describing someone's edit as """"POVing,"""" as you did, is fairly characterized as a personal attack.

Certainly not. The alphabet has been copied """"as is"""" from Swedish, and it has been so since Mikael Agricola began writing Finnish. Fortunately the Swedish alphabet contains enough sounds like Ä and Ö that Finnish speakers didn't have to design any new letters. Then again, unused letters like Q and Å remain. The last changes to Finnish orthography with respect to the alphabet were the changes from 'C' to 'K', 'X' to 'KS', 'TZ' to 'TS' and 'W' to 'V', in the 18th and 19th century. 'C', 'X', 'Z' and 'W' remained in the alphabet but were no longer used.

If it was always called Olzstyn in Polish, I stand corrected. I was perhaps confusing it with Ketrzyn, formerly Ranstenburg. (Is this a transliteration into Polish of Allenstein, as Frombork is a transliteration of Frauenburg?)

However, before 1945  the town was known to non-Poles as Allenstein, as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest. Witness also the League of Nations plebiscite in southern East Prussia, which as shorthand was referred to as """"the Allenstein district"""" (Cf. Churchill's memoirs). The plebiscite there in 1920 produced 97.8 percent (362,209 votes) for Germany and 2.2 percent (7,980 votes) for Poland.10  These are facts, widely reported at the time and cited in countless historical accounts since then.

okay about the navy having more fighters...I'm talking about numbbers not varity buddy. The navy HAS mroe PLANES than the air force.

You're wrong. The numbers show that the Air force has something on the order of 8000 total fixed wing planesthat's fighters, bombers, transports, tankers, trainerseverything. The Navy, as far as I know does not have that large a force of fixed wing aircraft.

I'm gald you can agree with me about Red Flag VS. Top Gun. Yes Red Flag is helpful and important just like TOp Gun, whether Air Force, Navy, Marine, Army, or even the coast guard, all American pilots should have the same opportunity. Jet fighters, bombers, or just even those planes the coast guard flay all of Americas pilots are good, but could probably become better.

ok

What do I mean when I say the aircrafts carriers have a bunch of planes? Well I mean I either read or saw something on TV. About aircraft carriers and that's what it said. I'm not sure exactly about the numbers, but from what I do know, what you said looks about right. That is pretty sad that EACH aircraft arrier has the fourth largest air force isin't it? Surpassed by only the entire USAF put together, Royal BRitish air force, and I think it said the Russians.

Eh... I still  think you got youir facts mixed up

Now about the Marines...The Marines are sort of their own branch, but not officially. Yes congress made Marine a proper noun, so when you write Marine you should capitalize the """"m"""" in Marine. Mearines are put on every ship the USN has. THere is also a reason Marines get Navy medals, (although yes they do have a few of their own). The Marines don't have their own medical DEPT. they go to the Navy for their medical mneeds. That's because the Marines are not officially their own branch. One thing the Navy and the Air Force share is the responsbility of deplyoment of ALL branches of the military Air Force flies most of the """"fighting men and women"""" to and from places that why I called the AF a """"bus force"""", also they do fly a couple tanks and armored vehicles, but the navy has a majority of the majority of the behicle responsiblity. f you e-mail me at """"_____"""" we can debate this a lost faster than Riley forgetting the paper every day.

Eh, it's semantics we're arguing here. They use the Navy's stuff, sure, but a lot of people don't consider them a real branch of the Navy. They have Navy beginnings, they use Navy equipment and assets, but that does not mean that they are members of the Navy""",0

 What is Linga? 

What is the Linga? And what is the meaning of the symbol? There are few ways to explain the meaning and the symbol of Linga.

1. Linga as Arthabrahma or phenomenal manifestation

Linga is the amorphous representation of Shiv and can be regarded as the highest emblem of Shiv because of its least anthrophomorphic nature. Shiv, Parabrahman, is the highest Divine Principle in intimate union with Divine Power, the Parashakti. The only positive qualities of this Divine Principle are Shat, Chit, and Anand. He is conscious of Himself i.e. He has Atmavimarsha. He is the cosmic Purusha (person) but is Nirakar - has no particular form and has no distinguishing mark. He is therefore inconceivable. """"God cannot be known by the mind or the physical senses"""" is consensus of all the sages. It is in this sense Herbert Spensor speaks of God as """" Unknown and unknowable."""" What he means is that Deity per se is """"Unknown and Unknowable."""" John Fiasco further argues that """"Deity is unknowable to the extent of it is not being manifested to consciousness through the phenomenal world knowable but knowable in order of its phenomenal manifestations: knowable in a symbolic way as the power of being rhythmic life of the universe; knowable as eternal source of moral law."""" If we accept this, then Shiv is inconceivable. But if He is not conceived, how can he be worshipped? Yet religious mind craving for eternal happiness cannot be satisfied without worship and cannot do without worship. He, therefore, requires some kind of representation or symbol of God. Without some concrete symbol of God, God would be a formless abstraction devoid of meaning to him/her. Hence it for those, who cannot digest abstract ideas of God, temples are built and images representing Gods in different powers and attributes are consecrated. Whatever may be said against images in the temples, rituals, and ceremonies, the fact remains that they are indispensable at a certain stage of the spiritual evolution life. 

Nirakar Shiv is Amurtha (formless) in his indistinct condition, and is Murtha or Sakar in his manifest condition –manifest in the form of universe. Shiv assumes eight-fold forms and is, therefore, called as Ashtamurthi. Then the Linga represents the whole universe appearing hemispherical placed on something. The Linga, the amorphous symbol of Shiv, thus, represents the Murtha form of Shiv. Hence, the Linga signifies Alinga or Shiv that has no special form or mark. The circular base with round semi-spherical top placed on it fits the description of the idea of Murthavthva.

2. Linga as Shabdabrahma

Shivaparabrahman is the cosmic Purusha having Atmavimarsha. He first vibrates in his Leele (play or amusement) towards creation. The vibration is Nada (a loud roar), the first expression as Nama or name. From his Nada proceeds Bindu (dot), i.e. the form. The couplet Nama and Rupa or Nada and Bindu are known as Onkara or Pravana. The Bindu is the disc-like Peetha and Nada is the line that supervenes the Peetha. The line stands on the Bindu like a cylinder with a rounded top. All this forms the Linga.

3. Linga as the Visvarupa

Shivaparabrahman has no particular form but is all-formed. He is, therefore, called Visvarupa. He is the creator of the Universe and assumes all forms in the Universe. He is hidden in all creatures, and pervades all and forms inner souls of all. He is said to have a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He has hands and feet in all directions. The semi-spherical top that supervenes the circular base represents this description of cosmic Purusha, with whom His devotees identify Shiv. The round top on the circular base really consists of thousands of heads, each of the size of a point. The sides of the cylindrical figure represents equally thousands of heads, eyes, and faces in all directions. The semi-spherical top, resembling the visible horizon, is truly symbolical of the universe that surrounds the earth on all sides. Though the symbol has no eyes and feet, or eyes and ears, it has thousands of hands and feet, heads, eyes, and ears in all directions, just as a circle has no face all around but it has faces in all directions at every point of the circumference. Thus the Linga is the closest possible representation of such formless or all-formed God Shiv. 

It is customary in nature that all classes of things in universe must have different shapes and forms. The so-called """"Gods class"""" must have different shapes and forms, though nobody knows what those shapes and forms should be. It is only the fancy of the human beings that has endowed Gods with some anthrophomorphic forms. But there is no proof of that. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that Gods have shapes and forms different from those of human beings as human beings have shapes and forms different from those of other animals,",0

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the """"axis"""", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that? The sentence seems somewhat forced, so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

There is a natural delay introduced between the last pulse (or only pulse in the case of the digit """"1"""") being sent and dial reaching its natural position, then an aditional delay before any further can be sent by the user turning the dial clockwise for the next digit.

In fact in many types of P.O. dial mechanism there was also a slight additional pause immediately upon releasing the dial and before the first pulse was sent, due to the design of the mechanism.  In the SxS switches which predominated in the British network, the inter-digit pause had to be long enough to (a) cause the relays in the current stage to recognize that the dialing of the particular digit had finished, and (b) to allow sufficient time for that stage to find a vacant circuit to the next and for that stage to prepare itself ready to receive the next digit.  31.185.230.165

To question 1, of course -) It's the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, after all. Probably won't even have to ask.
To question 2... to do that, you have to move the page; there's a tab for that. If you've been here for more than 4 days under this account, you should be able to move a page. To be honest, I've been here a while and have never moved a page, so I don't know the exact mechanics, but I'm pretty sure what you'll want to do is move your userpage to WebTrain or something similar. This will copy the content from your userpage to a newly created page, and your userpage will become a redirect, i.e., """"#REDIRECT WebTrain"""" will be the only text on your userpage... you will need to remove this to prevent your userpage from redirecting to an article (not good).

Later, a Dyer supporter (Carson) attempted to pass a motion of mild approval of Dyer, but was defeated 230 MPs (against approval), 129 MPs (pro-mild approval).

Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said """"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly."""" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the """"torsion field"""" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not """"just"""" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that """"torsion"""" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   """,0

Good Article review
Using the ever-changing meme catch phrases of the internet, this article is full of win! In other words, I find this article to be richly deserving to GA status, due to its high quality. There can, of course, be some improvements, but nothing that I think represents real failures of the Good Article criteria. The article is neutral almost everywhere, I see no sign of real instability, it seems to fulfill the specific MoS guidelines of the GA criteria nicely, there don't seem to be any obvious gaps in the article's coverage, the referencing is top quality, and the images all seem to be ok. I also have a few comments on more minor things that should help improve this article even further.
You mention """"Conservative clergy"""" as people who opposed the bank, but even though that is exactly the phrase the reference uses, i'm not so sure that's actually what the Islamic equivalent of clergy is called. Might want to look into that. 
The paragraph about the Global Elders seems like it doesn't belong, because it looks less neutral than the rest of the article. """"convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity together to the world."""" is entirely subjective and this line is not referenced, I presume this was meant as a direct quote of some statement they made, that should be referenced and the sentence should be framed in a way that makes it clear that it was from a statement, rather than a statement of fact according to Wikipedia alone. 
It looks like the paragraph has more to do with the Global Elders rather than Yunus. It should focus on that Yunus is a member, rather than talk about who is funding the Global Elders and who is the chair and all those details not directly relevant to Yunus. 
In the family section, """"His younger brother Muhammad Jahangir is a popular television presenter."""" doesn't seem to be referenced.

 Coup not Revolution 

First off, I removed the reference to """"after Yanukovich fled the country"""".  The term """"fled"""" is loaded and POV.  To say he """"left"""" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let's talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:

Revolution:  """"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.""""

Coup:  """"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.""""

Let me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.

There was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  """"Maidan Coup"""" or """"2014 Ukrainian Coup""""... but the term """"Ukrainian Revolution"""" is both POV and misleading.

Note:  Above I use the literal definition of 'Revolution' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of 'wide-ranging change' (e.g. the 'industrial revolution').

  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the """"Velvet Revolution"""" nor the """"Orange Revolution"""" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.

Hello guys. I am not in a hurry per say, my concern is that, until very recently, there has been no hint of the text being edited, only talks about it being re-written some time int he future, in the mean time, AFD, Proarepa and the Beyloune and Barrueco family are mentioned the biggest encyclopedia on planet hearth in a huge scandal, without them having had had anything to do with it. Just imagine. All news reports agree on where the money came from, who carried it, for whom he was carrying it, who was charged with the crime and who the money was for. None of those persons have anything to do with the companies and persons on list A. Of course the following suggestion is tainted with my stance on this matter, but, perhaps, until the article is re-written, the text in bold could be suppressed, at least temporarily:

""""According to El Nuevo Herald and El Universal, Antonini Wilson owns a condo in Ocean Club, Key Biscayne, Florida; together with Wladimir Abad, he is registered as owner of a building located in Mashta Avenue, in Key Biscayne, valued at $US3.96 million.[22] Wladimir Abad is the secretary of American Food Grain (AFG),[23] a part of a Venezuelan holding called Proarepa, owned by Sarkis Arslanian Beyloune and Ricardo Fernández Barrueco.[22][24] Proarepa was in charge of the food distribution during Venezuela's oil strike of 2002, when Chávez signed contracts for food distribution. According to the Venezuelan Government Press Office, Proarepa is a private company that has """"joined this mission (Mission Mercal) to offer food and better price to the Venezuelan consumer"""".[22] According to El Nuevo Herald, Antonini Wilson's name is linked to other companies in southern Florida, such as Venuz Supply Inc., Intertel Telecom and Techmilk Inc.;[22][25][26] La Nación says that Antonini is among a group of businessmen who benefited economically during the administration of Hugo Chávez.[26] In May of 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confiscated a jet belonging to American Food Grain. The report, according to The Miami Herald, says Ricardo Fernández Barruecos had not respected federal norms to register the plane in the United States.[22][23][27]""""
The mention of Antonini owning the condo with Abad will stay, since there is a link there.
What are your thoughts on that?

Just in this subject, I don’t talk about their whole competence. Don’t you agree?  As for the album a year on own label: Lucifugum is a self-releasing band just last 5 years (of 15 years existence). And it doesn’t make them less notable than they were in past. In interviews they explained their decision to make self-releases. It’s just because of a disappointment in labels which didn’t keep their word and promises (but NOT because of lack of interest to the band). “Vector 33” (the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum) was planned to be released on Drakkar prod., but  Drakkar didn’t release it in due time. That’s why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released “Vector 33” cd by themselves. It was the first Propaganda cd release. Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they don’t exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles. By the way, “Stigma Egoism” on Drakkar prod. is not a re-release, this is the first (and last at the moment) cd edition of this album (Propaganda released just tape version). Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetal.Com on cd format (a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might). I mean a critery for musicans, Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels.

Perseus missile - Description or Characteristics?
Your lack of English comprehension is appalling. Your edit summary reads, """"the section here describes the missile, not just lists its characteristics. Standard way of naming sections on similar articles. Also, i would be happy to compare GRE scores"""". You are making this oh so easy for me, but for your benefit I will simplify things by hypothetically replacing the missile with a person. If I were to describe a person - perhaps on a police report - what would it entail? Height, weight, hair and eye colour, age? Yes, but I may also go on to describe the persons observable behavior, actions and tone of voice etc, to the best of my ability. This is a fairly standard example of what would fit a description. 

The articles original sub heading - Characteristics - encompasses a more diverse and flexible approach to the subject, for example distinctive features or a distinguishing quality unique to that particular missile (or person!). It goes more in-depth, a wider representation of the subject. However, as defining Characteristics are very descriptive in nature, it is easy and common these days to make mistakes, just as you have clearly made the mistake of getting muddled with the correct use of description and characteristics (as represent by your edit summary).

Difference between a description and a characteristic?
Description: He is tall, 6ft 6.
Characteristic: It is his height of 6ft 6 that distinguishes him.

Any line segment can be divided continuously ad infinitum.
At all times, with each division, the length of each part shortens by a half,
while at the same time, the number of parts multiplies by two.
So, how can an infinite number of parts
make up a finite whole? Because for every division, the lengths
of the parts are reducing as fast as the number of parts are increasing.   

There is not enough in sources for Zeno's writings to fully justify saying that Zeno ever actually claimed that the sum of an infinite number of numbers is infinite - though he has been interpreted that way by some.

That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles.  This was WIKISTALKING and they went FAR beyond what they complained about. This was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. It was a clear abuse of power. I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong.

I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars.

Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up.

Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges.

2b2abfa22ba63b2f,""":::Even during the 1891 census, castes like Vilakkithalavan and Veluthedan were counted separately. 90% of the Nairs counted in 1891 belonged to the Kshatriya divisions. The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them """"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas"""". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them """"Nagara Kshatriyas"""" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. 

However the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four """"Suryavanshi"""" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). 

Regarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don't think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no """"conversion of caste"""". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added """"Nair"""" or """"Pillai"""" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.

I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper """"talk"""" process.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

And since such criticisms are subjective, and every single person in the world has an opinion, who's opinions are you going to put in this article? judaic """"scholars"""" ? christian """"scholars""""?
either make this article precise well cited criticisms of the verses of the quran, or delete the article.

Well there are more to come. If I can complete all of these articles, then I'll make a DYK out of each. Most I'll have to create.

I have the page on my watchlist, I forget which number we are up too, either in the late 70s or early 80s on DYKs. Well now, you are better off watching ROH's new show on HDnet. Here is a link to their new show: . That is the best wrestling going today. TNA lost all sense of direction. I hope they get back to their old ways, but now they seem like Raw. A crap load of promos and about 20 minutes of wrestling. Though last week's episode was very good. TNA are trying to raise the bar with Samoa Joe's new gimmick in which he gets himself DQed then beat the living hell out of the guy. Last week he hung a guy upside down by his feet and beat him like a pinata with a kendo stick. It was funny and great. Most hate it, since it is controversial, but I loved it. They need to raise the bar. Check it out if you want. They have a few good things going now but at the moment WWE are doing better. Hopefully after the storyline involving The Main Event Mafia and The Front Line in over, they'll go back to their old ways. Sting is supposed to retire this year. Angle might head back to WWE. If that is the case, then we'll get new blood in the main event. Sometimes I wish TNA would have never got Sting nor Angle, because since then TNA have been catering to them.C-Joe's gonna kill you!!!) """,0

Prodding the tiger
Please sir, I didn't mean it. The smoking was one o' them joke-thingies (""""Descartes? Whatever he was smoking, I want some...""""). 

But the language thing wasn't (tho it probably wasn't v competent either). My understanding of language issues is nothing like yours. But I do feel that there is no difference between languages and dialects except the issue of power (interrelated with codifying the language). And the language politics in Zimbabwe are complicated, I think even more so than RSA. South Africa (as far as my puny knowledge goes) has gone from appalling but simple language values to a situation where the politics and importance of language are openly discussed and the horrors of the past give a very clear marker of what to avoid. Zimbabwe, on this as on so many things, Won't Talk about it: if you've ever doubted the value of the TRC, take a look what happens when you don't have one. 

Btw, going direct to Mark is the right thing: I've been trying to get my head round your language stuff with the intention of passing it to him, as there's no way I would trust myself to incorporate most of that without supervision from you both.

 Fairness and neutrality of admins - your recourse 

Hi Nancy,

I think it's a difficult question regarding whether admins have treated you fairly or not.  I think you are not wholly innocent but I'm not convinced that you have been treated with an even hand either.

As you may know, I was surprised at and somewhat nonplussed that you and Xandar were blocked.  Heck, the whole straw poll/IAR/block incident is questionable in my book.  However, it all happened so quickly and during a period when I was less active at Wikipedia so I chose not to raise a ruckus about it as it seemed to be a fait accompli by the time I learned about it.

I gather you were rather strident at WP:ANI which is what triggered your block.  This all seems to be """"water under the bridge"""" by now so, rather than reopen old wounds, I would counsel that you learn from the experience and tone down your emotions even if you are being treated unfairly.

That said, it's clear to me that there has been a bit of admin myopia seeing incivility on your part while ignoring the same or worse on the part of other editors such as PManderson and others.  I have remarked on this a number of times at Talk:Catholic Church but did not act on it at the time because I was an involved admin.  (I'm not an admin anymore so I couldn't act on it now if I wanted to.)

As much as I think the current Catholic Church RFC over versions is ill-advised and likely to be inconclusive, it is now underway so I think we should let it run its course.  Once it's done, you might wish to consider a user conduct RFC to raise the fairness issues.  Note that user conduct RFCs are required to be restricted to one specific user.  Thus, you may wish to raise user conduct RFCs on different users such as UberCryxic, PManderson and even SlimVirgin.

I'm not saying that such user conduct RFCs will get you the satisfaction that you seem to wish.  However, I'm just pointing out what recourse you have if you choose to go down that road.  I reserve the right to decide my response to any such RFCs based upon the facts presented at the time.  (How's that for being a weasel?  Sorry.)

If there seems to be a consensus that you were treated unfairly, the results of the user RFC could be brought up in various forums such as WP:ANI or WP:ARBCOM.  Based on the history to date, however, you should take into account the fact that it is not a clear-cut case of unfair treatment so the user conduct RFCs could get quite contentious.  You have to decide for yourself whether or not issuing them would be worth it.

Now both Jayron32 and Fram are having memory lapses about how they did what they did, we are lucky to have diffs that can't lie. Fram's deletion conceals both my page and its history, that he uses to count the contributions. Fram says that the contribution by Baseball Bugs that Fram also deleted was """"minor"""". Is that supposed to mean """"unworthy""""? When Baseball Bugs posts to my page and the post is sensible, as it was, then no third person may delete it. But to Jayron32 and Fram, BB's post is merely collateral damage. Access to my deleted page, which I have asked for and been denied, will reveal that I was interrupted in the process of scanning the Ref. Desk archive. Anyone can do that because it's publically accessible. I became a humble recipient of The Reference Desk Barnstar (scroll up to see it) when I showed objective results. The first result showed Jayron32's contribution of references at RD/M to be among the highest, which likely gave Jayron32 satisfaction. That is understandable but I and many others cautioned that the measurement does not assess the quality of answers. The software I use may be improved but it would lose all credibility of objectivity if I allowed it to be biassed by anyone's feeling of being flattered or attacked by its output. @Fram, if you want AGF then stop hiding the page you deleted and it will be seen to be not just about Jayron32, it doesn't even contain the word """"mistake"""", and it has a portion still under construction.

'Macao' is the English name and 'Macau' is the Portuguese name - this is recognised by Macao and its sovereign state.

However, both are acceptable in English. It is just like using 'Munich' or 'München'. I am not trying to say that one of us is right and the other is wrong, I just want to draw your attention to the origin of 'Macao' and 'Macau'.",0

 Arundhati Roy's controversial comments on Gujarat riots in 2002 missing in """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section 

Hi,

Arundhati Roy's comments on Gujarat riots of 2002 that came in Outlook magazine when the riots were happening, which got very high media attention, when the enquiry proved false and subsequent apology was published in the same magazine, are one of the biggest controversial statement ever issued by her, which triggered widespread violence during the riots, is missing from """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section of the wikipedia article about 'Arundhati Roy"""".

Some of the comments in the article published in the Outlook magazine were 

""""Last night a friend from Baroda called. Weeping. It took her fifteen minutes to tell me what the matter was. It wasn't very complicated. Only that Sayeeda, a friend of hers, had been caught by a mob. Only that her stomach had been ripped open and stuffed with burning rags. Only that after she died, someone carved 'OM' on her forehead.""""

""""A mob surrounded the house of former Congress MP Iqbal Ehsan Jaffri. His phone calls to the Director-General of Police, the Police Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) were ignored. The mobile police vans around his house did not intervene. The mob broke into the house. They stripped his daughters and burned them alive. Then they beheaded Ehsan Jaffri and dismembered him. Of course it's only a coincidence that Jaffri was a trenchant critic of Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, during his campaign for the Rajkot Assembly by-election in February.""""

Common Interests of Troubled and Conflicted Souls

I see that you're idly floating speculative theories again, with another of your legendary flights of fancy. Rather than speculate without the benefit of evidence and reasoning, why don't you interview me to discover the nature and extent of my interest in troublesome (and troubled) individuals such as yourself. 

Are you a curious and courageous enough adventure writer to discover the unrevealed truth, or do you prefer to remain safely ensconced in a cocoon of child-like self-delusion, anonymity and utter indifference to the tragic harm caused by blindly acting out one's innermost fantasies? 

Rest assured, I am becoming increasing familiar with your legendary and oft-disclosed lack of caring, which seems to be a recurring issue in your life and recently published remarks.

And I appreciate that your dreadfully provocative remarks elsewhere may well be a transparent attempt to solicit the kind of caring that you apparently crave.

You have a keen sense of awareness of those who respond with a tiny measure of empathy and compassion to your repeated (dare  I say desperate?) cries for attention.  

So it appears you've chosen me as your antagonist, respondent, and reluctant mentor.  So be it.  I'm flattered.

Not that I'm necessarily up to the task, but I'll give it a decent college try.  Of course I fully expect to fail.  I don't yet have the level of competence required to discover how to work and play cooperatively with individuals of your unfamiliar stripe.

 Supposed influence on historical events 

I am entirely new to editing so I hope someone can guide me on this matter. The claim """"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States"""" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.

Where does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson's Bay Company was established, with the company """"joining"""" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don't see this event holding """"great influence"""" over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.

So what should be done about this exactly? The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate. In the meantime I updated the link, but it is worth repeating it doesn't validate the claim.   """,0

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused.

23)What trust can I have on your oath on Quran ? Otherwise you tell why should I have taken path of taking up the sword.
24)I do not know that this person (Aurangzeb) is cunning like a fox.Otherwise I would never have come to this place that is Chamkaur (by vacating Anandgarh on the false oaths of Aurangzeb and his men).

Impumozhi and his knowledge (or lack of) about rajputs
 

Incident 1: Impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on Hada page

Read this page for a little entertainment  in particular, the last three sentences, setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious (and probably fictitious) incident. Is this fit for an encyclopedia? Leave aside veracity, just the choice of words? Yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page: it is """"owned"""" by that presiding deity of obduracy, the learned protagonist of every page with a remote """"rajput"""" connection.

 Impumozhi's lack of knowledge exposed

His claim about Hada's character  being funny and un-encyclopaedic is actually taken from James Tod's Annals and Antiquities page 384 and 385 Vol-II: 
On the death of the queen Joda Bae, Akbar commanded a court mourning; and that all might testify a participation in their master's affliction, an ordinance was issued that all the Rajput chiefs, as well as the Moslem leaders, should shave the moustache and the beard. To secure compliance, the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. But when they came to  quarters of the Hadas, in order to remove these tokens of manhood, they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. Then enemies of Rao Bhoj Hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess, who it will be remembered was a rajputani of Marwar.  Akbar, forgetting his vassal's gallant services, commanded that Rao Bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. He might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. The Hadas flew to there arms, the camp was thrown into tumult, and would have soon presented a wide scene of blood-shed, had not the emperor, seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the Boondi quarters in person. He expressed his admiration (he might have said his fear) of Hada valour, alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the Rao...

If James Tod thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on Wikipedia?

 

Incident 2. Deleted the name of famous rajput lady, Maharani Gayatri Devi, from rajputani page, saying she is not a rajput.

His response: .

Impumozhi, on rajputani page deleted the name of Maharani Gayatri Devi . 
Then he was asked why he did so: .

His response was countered on his talk page:  and till date he has not responded. The reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed.

 

Incident 3: Impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted, but is thwarted.

In another incident he put a tag of db-nonsense on the article Hammir Dev Chauhan  . 
He was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the CSD tag: . No reasons given till date. Another user, , had to remove this db-nonsense tag: . Here again Impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the db-nonsense tag.",0

Hello there,

Yes it went on too far and I got my dander up. I am sorry about that. I notice nobody else has apologised to me that was not an edit war but an admin war: have your own admin wars but I got caught in the flak and if you fight, I will fight back. I am usually very well-mannered but some of the things being fired at me were just disgusting. Anyway let's put that in the past can we?

I still think it was unreasonable of Bishonen to demand my email address so that he or she can then abuse me privately rather than in the open on Wikipedia. Which is what I got in my emails. You only saw one side of it. That is why I left Wikipedia, got heated, and wanted to be taken off. I have contributed a lot to Wikipedia over the years – and if you take out you should put back – and that is what I try to do. I have made Hitchin Flyover from a section into a stub article for example. Not the best article, but it's a start.

I don't want the abuse any more than anyone else: but I didn't start it. Thank you for finishing it.

In the meantime there has been an investigation for sockpuppetry on this range of addresses of which I am one in Hungary. I'll try to find it for you cos my IPconfig just gives me the address of the gateway (as you'd expect) and not the landing address. But I can assure you it is not me: I have edited under IP not to avoid any ban (I had a WP:WIKIBREAK anyway while things cooled down) but it is certainly not me socking. Or if they think it is me, well the problem is solved: most of my contribs on the edit tags say SimonTrew editing as IP. I wasn't trying to avoid anything except the flak which – I think like you – I thought better to stay away and let it cool down, but still wanted to contribute to this excellent encyclopaedia which is free to everyone. It's all right for us in the first world but this is SO important to people who can't afford an encyclopaedia.

So I get it wrong sometimes but I think as we all are, I am aiming in the right direction. This should not have got so heated but I tried to cool it.",0

 as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib) 

 (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)

 So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too? 

 Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: 

  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) 

 Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. 

 And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it. 

 I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? 

 Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. 

 Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:

Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)

 You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.  

 In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""". 

 And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling. Why would you need to state such a thing, if not for the possibility that you might have s",0

I'm happy to help, but unfortunately I won't have time to deal with this in any detail for about 10 days.  I agree that Stevecyberbunny'''s edits are inappropriate, but I don't agree that they're vandalism: edits are only considered vandalism if an editor is attempting to harm the article.  In this instance, I think the editor believes he his correcting inaccuracies.  In my opinion, he is adding material not supported by reliable sources.  While this is inappropriate, it's technically different from vandalism.  For example, if no reliable, published source explicitly says Matt the Knife is, as he put it in an earlier edit, """"facing scrutiny,"""" or that his records have been challenged, then the article shouldn't say those things either.

First I have to ask you if you have any connection to the subject in the article, because that will limit the ways in which can mitigate the problem.  If you are affiliated with Matt the Knife in any way, it is generally considered inappropriate for you to be editing the article  with some important exceptions I'll come to in a moment.  Please have a look at Wikipedia: Conflict of interest to see if it applies to you.

Of course it doesn't have sockpuppet tags on. It's brand new, created for the sole purpose of vandalization. It's somebody breaking the rules. And BTW, I was not being uncivil. It wasn't a threat, it was a very specific promise of how I would follow up with his continued disruption, and I will.  You are being uncivil by continuing to harrass me, and also unreasonable in thinking somehow a sockpuppet created for the sole intention of vandalization actually can have its feelings hurt. This is what I would at this point consider the end of the discussion. Anything else would be a sign of uncivility.  
I'm not being remotely uncivil. I left a message and asked you not to be. You've now continued your uncivil behaviour by blanking warnings from your talk page. Promise or threat amounts to the same uncivil behaviour. There was no reason to threaten them with an IP ban. 
You are attacking me with warnings and attempting to set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner so you can complain about me, probably to subvert the vote for deletion against the Michael Everson article. You responded to my warning the vandal about his vandalism so quickly, it raises my suspicion that it may be in retaliation for my very quick reversion of the vandalism that occured at the AfD. You are behaving in such a manner that seems to be attempting to troll me by continued action after being warned to leave me alone. I disagree with you plainly that I behaved uncivily. It is not required of me to agree with you. I also consider your warning of me behaving uncivily a personal attack and am removing it. 
If you want to find an arbitrator for arguing over nothing, that is directly your next step as per the arbitration guidelines.   
Leaving a warning template for obviously uncivil behaviour isn't uncivil. Otherwise no one could leave them. Retaliating with that template however is uncivil. I've pointed out the issue with your behaviour, you can correct it or not, but launching a personal attack against me won't help you. As for the AfD you're involved in, I could care less, I have no interest in it. 
And again I'll remind you: You are in charge of how you behave and respond. """"set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner"""". If you behave uncivily, its your fault, no one else's. No one has held a gun to your head to force you to act in the manner you are.

 Housewife 

You're right Dybryd, WP:BLP says nothing about how we shouldn't mention that he's gay because he doesn't want us to, the fact that he's self-identified is all that matters.  We don't do anything purely because the subject of an article wishes it.  I find it very confusing that Brannan went on that rant against Wikipedia saying he was gay, that he didn't want such attention focused upon his gay identity, in light of the new promotional video for a song on his upcoming album; """"Housewife"""".  If Brannan really didn't want a focus to be on his homosexuality, he wouldn't have singled that song out for promotion.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed",0

Jerry Robinson said, “[Bill] had more to do with the molding of Batman than Bob. He just did so many things at the beginning,…creating almost all the other characters,…the whole persona, the whole temper.”

It is from page 43 of BILL THE BOY WONDER (already cited in article). I feel it is the most compelling and authoritative statement explaining how significant Bill's role was, and Jerry is certainly in a position to make such a statement as he was one of the ghost artists who began on the strip during its debut year. He worked closely with both men before National hired him and Finger away from Kane. There is considerable misconception about how involved Kane was in the creative aspects of the strip. He was not an idea man and in fact did not write a single Batman story in his lifetime.

 CSP is server-side (has to be configured at each server, sends reports to the server), while ABE is client-side (configured in browser, logs results in error console).
 CSP just allows or blocks content, whereas ABE can take other actions like stripping authentication.
 CSP was primarily designed to stop cross-site scripting and other injections, while ABE was primarily designed to stop cross-site request forgery (but can defeat XSS/injections too).
 CSP allows wildcards, ABE allows either wildcards or regular expressions.
 CSP specifies only hostnames, ABE can specify full addresses including protocol and path.
 ABE knows about intranet vs internet addresses and can control traffic between them (in fact, it does this by default).
 CSP doesn't try to control requests originating from privileged code eg browser extensions. ABE can, although it is always possible for privileged code to defeat this, so it cannot be relied on to protect against malicious addons.
 ABE can distinguish between different types of object inclusions and different HTTP methods.
 They can work independently; if either blocks something, it will be blocked.

 vague point

Biography

Offenbach's father, Isaac Juda Eberst, born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main, took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.    
Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach """,0

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman""",1

Right,
 
I've now become an expert at near east archaeology, it took me a while to read up and write all the wikipedia articles about the sites, archaeologists and official bodies that we need to contact to get things going.
 
What we need to do is to contact the people that I am gradually creating a database of on Wikipedia with a CONSTANTLY updating thesis of the Pre pottery neolithic B “megasite” that we have discovered in the Aaiha plain and temporary wetland. Linked by Edward Robinson in the 1800s to be the source of the Jordan river. 
 
What I am doing here is completely rephrasing the O’Brien thesis into something that the mainstream of science will accept. We need to ditch the great work of Christian and move on, recognise why he didn’t get the attention he deserved but come with another angle. That of archaeology, that of science. We need to prepare a completely revised thesis, possibly leaving out ALL DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE and soley relying on the physical remains, the limestone plaster structures, photos and videos related in a totally academic way.
 
If we can prepare a credible archaeological thesis to present to Frederic Husseni, Danielle Stordeur, Maya Haidar Boustani, Levon Nordiguain, Pablo from the spanish Prehistoric institute of Cantabria, Bassam Jamous, Avi Gopher, Nigel Goring Morris, Frederic Abbes, Jean Perrot, Lorraine Copeland, Peter Wescombe, Paleorient, Archeorient, Colin Renfrew, Graeme Barker, Andrew Garrod, Alex Wasse, The directors and researchers at MOM, Leila Badre, Henri de Contenson, the Fernand Corby institut, JJ Ibanez, the polish team that excavated Tell Qaramel, the university of basel people, the french guy who did Tell Halula, the germans working on baalbek and others, the americans in chicago and probably many, many others I can probably mention by studying.
 
I can get all their e-mails. I can prepare a doctorate level thesis without even mentioning O’Brien, who has been wiped from Wikipedia as an unreliable source.
 
Something like this needs to be done to get the results we all want.
 
Further suggestions welcome.

 GayVN Awards redirects 

Thanks for your help in deleting the pages that were merged. However, I'm disappointed that the redirects weren't deleted, regardless of how """"cheap"""" they are. 

I can't find anything that says redirects have to be kept in the case of merging a page. (Which would make sense in most cases, I'm sure, but not when the name of the merged page is not one that someone would likely search for.) I can, however, find support for deleting them. Wikipedia:Redirect#When should we delete a redirect?, item 1. states, """"The redirect page makes it unreasonably difficult for users to locate similarly named articles via the search engine.""""

I believe that leaving the redirects meets this guideline. Here's the top of the results list when searching for """"gayvn"""", in order of appearance. There are 51 results listed. Redirects are marked (R); correct pages are bolded. Non-existent pages are italicized.

and others ...

Having to slog through 15 extraneous """"hits"""" for non-useful redirect pages seems unreasonable to me; it's nearly a third of the search results. The redirects aren't useful as they are too specific to be considered likely search phrases.

User:24.167.138.84 may exist, but 24.167.138.84 is a volatile IP address. Keeping a comment directed at a particular user of a volatile IP address that may never be used by that particular user again, about a page that has been merged/deleted, seems needless. While equally useless, for some reason he doesn't show up in the search list. (More evidence that there's something wrong with the index.)

User:Overdrive10/Kent Larson and User:Overdrive10/Chris Steele show up further down on the list as well; neither of these pages contains any reference to GayVN (they're both blank); I'm sure they did in the past as they were probably sandboxes for articles. However, there has been no activity on either page since 16 June. 

User:Fabartus/Sandbox also shows up in the search results but doesn't mention GayVN anywhere on that page; nor has s/he done so since 13 April. That entry appears to be part of a copy and paste of another user's contributions log with comments, and was created by a user with an IP address (most likely Fabartus's, however).

In these cases and the case of the two pages listed above that don't actually exist but are being returned as part of the search results, I think there's an obvious """"glitch"""" somewhere - apparently in the search engine indexing. Is it not being refreshed on a regular basis? I thought it happened every 24 hours.

Any road, it would be nice to have the 15 redirect pages removed and their entries in the search results eliminated (and I'm not sure that the former results in the latter). Equally desirable would be to have the search index updated to reflect the non-existence of pages. Is that something that you can do, or know to whom a request should be made to do so?

Any chance of some further assistance here?

 Too many pictures 

One amature picture of cable ends is enough.  Users find it a lot more useful to have a detailed pinout for their reference.

 Refresh / Update 

I have made some edits that are (hopefully) viewed as an improvement on the original.
 I added references to both the T568-A and T568-B """"standards"""" to the pinout tables.
 I copied (and modified) the original table, showing it as a four-pair crossover, since the newer network types need all four pairs crossed.
 I added explanatory comments about the T568-A/B wiring formats, since in my experience this has been a source of confusion. (They really are interchangeable, you just need to use the same format at each end.)
 I also inserted comments between the two pinout tables explaning that there may be situations where the """"older"""" style may be preferable - and that some equipment can be fussy about which pairs are crossed, and which are not.
 I broke out the """"Cable Pinouts"""" and """"Other Technologies into separate sections to make things clearer.

Comments:

Thanks to whomever added the pictures and the original table.  They really help liven up the page and make the information much more easily grasped.

Regarding the comment about """"Wikipedia not being a 'user manual' but merely a 'source of information'...""""  Where do you/we draw the line?  I came to Wikipedia, as a source of information, and in this case the """"how-to"""" kind of information is often what the visitor wants.

In my own case, I came here looking for information about how to make the cable and found the tabular form for the pinout (now pinouts) most instructive.

Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.

I think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).

On a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007",0

I'll confess to being a bit lost among these theological discussions. I can say that we should include all significant points of view, even Geaves'.

More broadly, I'd remind everyone that we have an entire article devoted to Rawat's teachings, Teachings of Prem Rawat. The material in this article should simply be a summary of that article. Since the introductory section of that article should also summarize that article, in an ideal world we could simply copy to the intro here as a summary. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world. That article has needed work for years, but there hasn't been any significant editing there in the past year. May I suggest moving this discussion to that talk page?     talk   """,0

Ambush or Massacre?

Is 10 a """"large number""""? I personally think not. In which case this should be renamed to """"incident"""" or """"attack"""" or similar. Otherwise any terrorist attacks that kill 10 or more people should likewise be listed as a """"massacre"""". Wikipedia will quickly fill up with """"massacres"""" diluting those that really are massacre of large numbers of people.    
Agree. Renaming, per the discussion here NoCal100 (talk)

Scorpion pass is referred to as an ambush by the majority.

Lipman ambush
Israel Misard Ha-huts ambush
Nissim bar-Yaccov Incident

Liliental attack
Morris massacre/terrorist outrage
The strange use of 'massacre' by morris: On the night of 16/17 March ‘infiltrators’ ambushed a civilian bus travelling up Scorpion Pass (Ma’ale ‘Akrabim) on its way from Eilat to Tel Aviv. In the worst terrorist outrage against Israel between 1949 and 1956....Arye Efrat, complained to the government of the desperate security situation; of the burden of guard duty; and of families leaving. He concluded: ‘though nothing like Ma’ale ‘Akrabim has happened to us so far, the way things are going, if no steps are taken immediately, it could end in another such [massacere].

 Disambiguation Links 

Hi Evilbu,

What I changed on the Quadric (projective geometry) page was simply an incorrectly directed link to a disambiguation page.  The link to """"field"""" had been linking to field, which is the disambiguation page for the word """"field"""", but I changed it to link to the correct page, field (mathematics).  

What you went to when you clicked on the """"you can help"""" link should have taken you to Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links, which is a wiki fixup project.  The project works to fix all wikilinks that link to disambiguation pages, and instead have the links link the specific article that they refer to.

Hi Ma'am, I really appreciate your politeness in addressing my edits and also explaining to me kindly about the issue. I now understand it. However, I would like to submit that the sacred texts like the Yajurveda, Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are accepted as authoritative texts on the Hindu religion by a majority of the Hindus.

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Tokyogirl79.  I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

Your appeal

Here's your appeal for retention of the Sabal article, which will soon be deleted. You may wish to recycle it elsewhere.

This article is very relevant to fashion photography section. He is noted as a top emerging """"fashion"""" photographer by one of the most prestigious fashion magazines. You do not shoot for
Vogue Magazine on any level foreign or domestic, if your not accepted across the board by Conde Nast. (The largest """"Fashion"""" publishing house in the world)
He has 8 pages in Vogue Brazil this Month( Jan 09), 8Pages in Sept of 08. (Which is referenced and linked) Plus, Spanish Vogue.
 Come on this is not unbiased judgement which I would expect from Wiki.
 However I trust this process will work. And it will be review unbiasedly. )

About me I am a fashion journalism freshman at NYU and this is my assignment to add a relevant fashion person to Wiki. This seems to be a personal issue if it's blocked.
I see Mr. Sabal's images on covers, editorails and shooting top models on youtube. He is far more accredited than half of the people on the current fashion photography section; if not more than half.

Being published in Vogue Magazine internationally and having shot most of the top supermodels for very notable fashion clients is far more than half the section already accepted by Wiki.
 His charity acts, and his personal life seem to make him a very interesting and notable personality and relevant to the section. 
(However, I am willing to leave out the personal stuff because it doesnt matter somuch even though the references are fashion people.)

Had I not found the Vogue and Surface Magazine references, the videos on youtube shooting a top Victoria's Secrets Angel- I would pass and not spend the time.
I dissagree completly with deleting a Vogue photographer from this section, if anything based on the fashion photography section, all these music video directors and
foreign portrait photographers should be eliminated instead of a full fleged fashion photographer, with notable """"fashion clients, magazines and """"Supermodels"""".

7908bec5c6456ce8,"I completely agree with you, we cannot expect aliens to interpret pictures, movies, sound and text the way we do. Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you. It will take them years to analyze what we have sent them and make sense of it (ie: convert it to something they can relate to), but if they feel as lonely as us, then I trust that they will invest the resources and time.",0

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly """"lying"""" at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied. Obviously, anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth.""""... Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at """"deeptrivia (talk) """", which I later on found and I replied to you at """"csssclll()"""", which you should be aware of because you replied at """"Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) """" but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?!

 visual examples of painting media 

This article is very limited as to the types of paint media.  There should be a full article on oil painting, etc...  At the absolute least this page should present a visual example of all of the types of painting media.  To have two """"fresco"""" examples and nothing for pastel, watercolor, ink, gouache, enamel, spray paint, tempera, or water miscible oil paint, is very lacking.  Providing 1-2 examples of each would improve this section greatly.  It may be a rare prose-to-image ratio spacially (i.e. more images per area than normally used) but it would help make up for the lack of extended articles, because we all know a picture is worth 1,000 words, right?

In biology, evolution refers to the processes that cause some inherited traits to become more common relative to others over time. Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.

Over time, the accumulation of many of these inherited changes can result in the development of new species from existing ones,  a process called speciation. [Explain major routes of speciation: geographical differences, isolation, divergence into seperate niches, etc]

[Simple evidence, probably the Universal genetic code] and other discoveries have shown that this mechanism can be traced back to a single common ancestor, from which all living organisms on Earth descended as a result of cumulative evolutionary change over billions of years, making evolution responsible for the vast diversity of life on Earth, including the many extinct species found in the fossil record.

 Obviously there is some anti-Americanism in Canada. This means nothing, necessarily, with regards to the structure of this article. I was referring to the specific idea that Canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed, or that Canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to Americans. And I asked for another side of the story, and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. Your response here is confusing. As far as """"citing my sources"""", I am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article, not making additions to the article. Several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim anti-Americanism on the basis of involvement in the Middle-East... that doesn't mean it's a relevant enough addition to put into the INTRODUCTION of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world, that is meant to specifically talk about the MAJOR issues between two specific countries. 

As far as your sources go, you did not comment on the obscurity of them. You have still not properly defended James Tagg (yes, that was me who removed that a year ago). I don't see why you get to just dub a source """"reliable"""", when I thoroughly explained why I determined it """"unreliable"""" (or, rather, inappropriate to add). I read that source, left you detailed comments, and you said something like """"Don't POV push"""" and reverted my edits. You are not making an argument here. (re: Culture Clash in Archive 2)

Again, there are two sides to every story. Please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. Many Canadians would laugh at the idea that the USA causes a """"profound fear"""" that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed (and why do students' opinions have so much weight, by the way?). But there likely won't be many sources to support this, because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldn't exist for a counter argument. Nevertheless, I'll take a look...

One last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality, and onesideness breaching neutrality. I am not trying to say that what you're saying is not true at all. I'm sure it is true the the extent that it is. But how much is that? The points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article, that they should be immediately moved.""",0

 Dubious claim
The claim that Russia invented the lightning rod is doubtful for two reasons. First, it is unverifiable that Nevyansk tower, built between 1725 and 1732 was intended for the specific purpose of being utilized a lightning rod.

Origin of Afshin

Dear Atabek,
Some of the sources mentioned are not scholarly or outdated.
What are the qualifications of these authors relative to Bosworth, Bernard Lewis and Daniel Pipes (who did his work on this topic: D. Pipes. Turks in Early Muslim Service — JTS, 1978, 2, 85—96).  

Note I am talking about the qualification of these:
A)
Rose, Hugh James; Rose, Henry John; Wright, Thomas (1848). New general biographical dictionary, Volume 2. Fellowes. p. 424. http://books.google.com/books?id=f2AMAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA424. """"the whole force of the khalifate was directed, under a Turkish general of great celebrity, named Afshin, to crush this monstrous sect""""  

1848?

B)
Hasan, Masudul (1998). History of Islam: Volume 1. Islamic Publications. p. 224. http://books.google.com/books?id=TPsPAQAAIAAJ. """"After the failure of some campaigns, Mutasim sent a large force under his Turkish General Haider Afshin to suppress the revolt and capture the Brigand at all costs.""""  

What is the scholarly qualification?

C)
Chisholm, Hugh (1910). The Encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information. The Encyclopædia Britannica Company. p. 48. ISBN 0742562964. http://books.google.com/books?id=Sv8tAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA48. """"Motasim made Afshin, a Turkic prince who had distinguished himself already in the days of Mamun, governor of Media, with orders to take the lead of the war against Babak""""  

1910 is outdated.  

D)
Glassé, Cyril (2008). The new encyclopedia of Islam. Rowman & Littlefield. p. 80. ISBN 0742562964. http://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&pg;=PA80. """"the Turkic general Afshin subdued Babak by taking the fortress of Badh in 222/837""""  

The person is not a university academic.

Please provide justification on what level these sources are on the same level as Bosworth, Bernard Lewis and specialized article on Turks in early Muslim service.
H. M. Balyuzi , G. Ronald, the University of Michigan. 1976: """"Afshin was of princely descent, his ancestors having ruled Transoxania, and he was not a Turk, but an Iranian"""".

  The Civility Barnstar Your recent edits on historical Jesus deserve this star, because you used a novel approach that didn't give civility for it's own sake, but where it was deserved. Many people have tried to edit pages on Jesus, Religion in Nazi Germany, Religious views of Adolf Hitler, etc. and run into the exact situation you described. When they approach it with too much civility they get run off and bullied by teams of Christian editors. It's about time someone approached the situation with the civility that is needed.

They've been doing it for 2000 years, is it any surprise that Wikipedia wouldn't be a magnet for Christian interpolations?

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles. Open for more discussion. """,0

8eb640ff8a12d653,"Question about guardian angels
According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says
1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there
are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad
angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)

Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that
a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.
I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this
makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world
population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to
be assigned 24 to 25 people.

Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?

Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 million
people on the earth? (The world population reached 266 million around the year 1000 or so)",0

My concept is Background, Game play (all the way to the end), Network and reaction (might have to be split depending on length, and Aftermath.  Cut out most of the present article.  The Jets were pretty upset about the officiating and were eventually fined by Rozelle, which had nothing to do with the television.  Michaels and Dr. Andrews were pounding on the official's locker room, Walt Michaels was shooting off his mouth, and they called the reporters in midweek to show game film of """"blown"""" calls by the officials.  The Jets stayed in Calif as they were playing San Diego the following week.

I shall need you to modify the image descriptions as I upload game program images that I screenshot off eBay so they have an archive url.  The eBay links will rot in a few months.  The first is here.  I think we shall have a well illustrated article by the time it runs main page.  
No problem. The archives are going to look a bit messy but at least we'll have a record of them.   Talk 
I care not about the mess.  Thanks.  I have a few images up, more coming but I have to get back on the road!  By the way, I saw a source that said that the 1968 AFL championship was to be played at the East Division Champ.  Alternating divisions.  The NFL did something similar for many years.  
I had a bit of a laugh out of this (snatched it off a 1962 ticket order form).  Ample restrooms?  I guess they were counting the ramps.  
Ha!   Talk 
I put a mention of ample restrooms in the image caption in the History article, and Jets fans should get a good laugh.  Images are up, I stopped because I did not want to crowd the article.  I'll keep uploading later.  I will substitute in the Namath shot, unless you have a better idea (from the four page newsletter, Jet Stream they used to send to season ticket holders, I think they did so into my tenure as a season ticket holder (since 1986).  
You have built up a very impressive collection and the article looks great! The images will help make it easier on the eyes for sure. The Namath shot is fine besides, he was an important part of the team's success and should be depicted. Some brief thoughts: After this season we'll have to re-visit the article and, in all liklihood, split it at the 90s, I would say. I'm still determined to capture the elusive photo of Rex in his element as I return to Foxboro in October, here's hoping my camera will function properly so we could add that to the article. We may also be able to grab something from the Commons for Sanchez if I can't capture him either.   Talk 
I was thinking about a split at 1969, right after the blockquote I just added.  The AFL material is more detailed.  Next time I go to a day game I'll bring my camera.  Maybe even a night.

When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were being servile to the Slavs to the point of debasing themselves, as one who is utterly mendicant, whilst disfavoring the Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary.

""""SATANLOVESGAYMEN"""" was being used as an example of where I personally finding that as a complement as I also love Satan while others may see it as an insult.  Others seeing that as an insult is their right.  I could put """"HAILSATAN666"""" as my username and i'm sure you'd probably say that's offensive too whereas I'd say that's kind of a religious motto and greeting.  What part of that (SATANLOVESGAYMEN) is """"offensive""""?  If you don't like that or interpret it a different way, you're welcome to do so.  That is kind of one of the important aspects of Satanism.  The word """"Satan"""" can go anywhere that """"GOD"""" can and shouldn't have a different reaction and if it does... not my problem.  Your note and whole argument, and actions against me are outright fallacious and simply trying to use everything i say in a manipulative and out of context manner.  As with the Fred Phelps article, placing that particular addition to his wiki was showing counter resistance to his viewpoints of hate.  So yeah, I'll be sure to see about how i challenge this further.  You don't really belong on this site as an admin if you can't see what you're doing or at least should not be reviewing any article or addition having to do with religion and in particular Satanism.  Take your Satanic_panic elsewher.  Calling my views """"trolling"""" is designed as an insult to my character and opinions and simply false.  I'm not here to necessarily go along with popular views nor be censored.  If I do something that is vandalism, yes i agree it does need to be corrected.  I did no such thing and maybe, maybe my reaction was a little overboard however yes i am new at making a lot of edits and never had such blatant and targeted censorship occur on here before.  What you did was outright biased censorship based on your lack of understanding of subjects that you obviously don't have any business of editing or should maybe check the legitimacy before hand.  What you're basically saying is my religious tenantshttp://thesatanictemple.com/about-us/tenets have no place on wikipedia such as """" The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own."""".  In my postings i did not make a single attack but rather placed factual additions with references.  Now you're obviously spearheading an aggressive attack trying to also go after my username i've been using for quite some time.    """"Disruptive""""...  Really... because history and text about history isn't going to be a little disruptive.  If articles have mass bias, need mass overhaul, and so on and that qualifies as """"disruptive"""" yes, i do plan on being disruptive.  However, i am learning a little more about how to use Wiki Syntax and the proper places to put arguments.  Yeah right, you're not being biased nor making an attack..... right.  Do you want to poke me in the right direction for further petition and complaint?  You'r basically having me admit i must be submissive to you who i obviously don't have much respect for and rightfully so based on your actions and displayed ignorance.  I guess i should appeal to other members of my religion and church to make arguments and complain on my behalf against this action.  """,0

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:FishbonePromo.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Graeme, I just figured out how to answer you back directly on your user page. Thanks for your message. I would greatly appreciate you placing the proper license in my images for me. Also, I saw the copy of the license that someone put on Village Pump. I had difficulty locating it in the """"Commons"""". Also, please note that the dekolb paintings are not copyrighted at all (I said they were before). I have started to upload the paintings under a Attribution Share3.0 license. Is this correct?  I know I am going to have to fix the licensing for my downloads and do them again.  If you could help me I would appreciate it.

Also, I notice that underneath the picture """"storybook romance"""" that there is a reference #1 for eric dekolb-wartenberg, and it gives the date March 10, 1916. I looked at the subpage you created and couldn't find this date. Also, it says """"New York"""" underneath it. I would assume that deKolb was born in Vienna. Also, I will ask Mrs. deKolb more about the death of EricdeKolb. I really appreciate all of your help. Thank you so much. I would like to get this all done before the April 15th date.

 Phases of migraine terminology

2006-10-08T13:23:04 Msteri (Talk | contribs) m (?Aura phase - This was NOT a typo. """"Headache phase"""" is appropriate AND from the source cited. Please do not change this again.) 

From User talk:Milomedes 
When I typed """"headache phase,"""" that's exactly what I meant. It was not a typo. Headache phase is as correct as pain phase, and headache phase is the terminology used in the source that I very carefully cited. Why did you feel it necessary to make this change? It makes no sense to me to take up people's time in this fashion. 
Thank you, 
 

This is a community issue so I'm moving it to the talk page. Milo  

First, I didn't think it was a typo. Both """"headache phase"""" and """"pain phase"""" terms are (or were) in use, though I don't know which is used more commonly. I do know that """"pain phase"""" is a better term for three reasons: 1) abdominal migraine isn't in the head, 2) the """"headache"""" word is recursively overused, 3) """"-ache"""" underdescribes the sensation, and, 4) """"pain"""" is shorter. You can argue with 2), 3),4), but 1) is technically a debate stopper.
Second, with all due respect to your professional writing expertise, just because you carefully copied the words that were used in your source, doesn't mean that I can't substitute different words that I have reason to think are better. I quote from concluding text at the bottom of every edit page: 
""""Please note: If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it. """"
Third, Wikipedia isn't about you or me. I didn't know you wrote it, and it shouldn't matter that you did. This is an interactive community process. If you think I'm taking up your time, then you probably don't have enough time to write here. Furthermore, if you assume that anything you write here is still going to be here, say, 10 years from now, then you probably don't understand the nature of Wikipedia. 
As to disagreements about which terminology to use in the article, that is usually handled with a talk page poll. I respectfully suggest that we use that tool as needed.  """,0

Thanks for your input on the Pump RE caps.

 Cathedral names 

The usual policy to use common names for page titles: Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names).   21:28, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

It is policy to use the offical name not the names crtins like you want to use. If you revert my mods I will report you under 3rr. 21:30, 2005 Mar 6 (UTC)

No, the official policy is to use common names, not official names.  See link above. We don't have an article titled """"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"""". And no personal attacks, please.   21:32, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
I regard your vandalising aof my mods as a personal attack. Who is this 'we' then. Wikipedia may or may not have article. I will correct the UK problem as soon as possible. 21:41, 2005 Mar 6 (UTC)

Jiunkrn Ireland???? Stop what you are doing or you will be blocked, and an RfC will be filed against you. This is your last warning.   21:49, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Blocked for what. I haven't broken any rules. It's you he needs to be banned. 21:54, 2005 Mar 6 (UTC)

Although it could be argued that your previous page moves were part of a naming dispute, that last move of United Kingdomedited United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to Jiunkrn Ireland  is clearcut page-move vandalism with no possible justification.   21:56, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

You have a history of personal attacks (""""cretins"""" above, and I seem to remember you referring to Violetriga as """"Vile Riga"""").  Remember that Wikipedia:No personal attacks is also official policy.   22:01, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

, I really don’t care whether this article states that the suspect origins are Sino-Korean or not (largely because I think the theory is a whole bunch of Korean nationalist propaganda). However, if you’re going to edit the article, at least use grammatical English. Instead of writing:
On the other hand, some scholars have suspected that the real reason for the refusal may be Japan’s worry about the possibility of finding evidence of elsewhere origins to the Japanese imperial line therein.
Write:
On the other hand, some scholars have suspected that the real reason for the refusal may be Japan’s worry about the possibility of finding evidence of the Japanese imperial line’s suspected xenogenesis therein.
“Xenogenesis” comes from “xeno-”, a prefix meaning “foreign” or “alien” (like the “gai” in “gaikokujin”), + “genesis”, meaning “origin” or “creation” = “foreign origin”; it is mainly used in biology to mean something different, but I think the rarer usage will be understood here.  12:15, 1 February",0

Now that the communist threat is gone, it's no longer necessary to accommodate basic decency in dealing with employees, for example. I have worked on the bottom of the food chain long enough to know how many liberties some employers take with their employees. The irony is, of course, that out of fear of Communism, working conditions in the West were much better than in Communist countries. I still think the masses are cowardly, nasty, stupid, and disgusting in general. But, that's regardless of who they are made up of. Any assembly of people that exceed about a hundred people tends to take on disgusting behaviour. Just watch frat parties at 'elite' universities. Yuck. You don't even need 100 people for that. Humanity as such is vile, it's only redeeming feature is the occasional decent human being. My support for democracy is not based on any kind of sympathy with 'the masses', but it's simply based on the realization that there are no better alternatives. I am a Popperian democrat  democracy as a necessity, not moral imperative. The losing side of any revolution is always humanity (Menschlichkeit, not Menschheit; I trust you know enough German to get the difference). 

The famines inflicted on India, Ireland, and post-WWI Germany are just one of the few examples of how humans in general are simply disgusting. By the way, according to new findings in archeology, genocide was the method of choice in dealing with enemies for most of human history. Whether the 'noble savages', the carriers of 'white man's burden', the 'Ubermenschen', or the 'Avantgarde of the Proletariat', humans have not gotten better or worse throughout history, but have simply found new excuses for their native instincts.

Thanks for your kindness. I could hardly explain the critical facts/reasons of blocking, since, if you read my rather long discussions above, it appears that, I still have to ask the blocking administrator, the details (terse facts of how, what, when, where, circumstances, from the very short time of about 1 day and a half, I had been warned not to add in my edits, the legal name and age of User:Cma, until the time I was blocked). 
Unfortunately, I cannot find the links of the ANI. I will have to prepare a rather terse but good argument for the appeal. Note that when I posted the template, instead of submitting the reason as mandated by template, I asked for time to submit the reasons or grounds, hence, automatically, the declining administrator denied my 1st appeal. I know the rules, and that resulted to outright dismissal of the first appeal; but I can file another appeal, provided, I will not abuse the rules on multiple appeals. 
If you please, I need to email you in confidence, on how you can help me. There is a process amid your vast experiences as administrator. All I wrote above are true and correct in all honesty amid the incredibility of some of my allegations. I cannot, however, reveal here some sensitive informations, which, might prejudice or affect the non-Wiki or off-Wiki processes that I had contemplated or had begun in utter secrecy to protect the sanctity of the processes, Wiki, wise or otherwise.

Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading """"Esperanza"""", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.

Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.

Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  """,0

Hace días hizo una recreación de artículos borrados como Mi Corazón es Tuyo y Hasta el Fin del Mundo, que otro bibliotecario le borró, esto es algo ya cansante, no se puede estar abriendo una consulta de borrado para cada artículo que este usuario crea. Por eso pido que se tome esto en cuenta, lo único que hace es ignorar los mensajes que se les deja, y yo no pienso seguir dejandoles mensajes. Saludos y gracias ).  TALK2ME

 Meditteraneanism? 

Does Mediterraneanism merit its own article? It seems to be a reactionary counter-Nordicist movement. One of the earliest examples I can find is in an issue of The Fascist by the Imperial Fascist League (a British-Nordicist Fascist group). In issue #65, October 1934, it quotes Mussolini as saying: """"We can afford to look with disdain upon these doctrines which are coming from the North. In the South we had Virgil, Cicero, and Augustus before the Germanic Race could either read or write."""" This seems to be a promoting a sort of Mediterraneanism  the superiority of Mediterranean culture and civilization (though not necessarily race, although it might be implied) over the Nordic one. Mediterraneanism is also discussed by Aaron Gillette in his book Racial Theories in Fascist Italy.   """,0

to an alleged copyright violation.  So your alleged basis for undoing my deletion was

d2f32ad4161c7198,"Sorry dude, as a physicist I know that there is not any generally accepted position on whether the universe had a prime mover or whether one was necessary or not or whether there is a necessary being.  Our only two cites for this section, which claims the argument has been scientifically refuted, which is not true, are a popular science book and a popular science lecture.  Now I'm not disrespecting Kaku or Hawking, but Hawking's statement that there was not time before the universe began is not his, it goes back to Augustine of Hippo, which Hawking says in I believe A Brief History of Time, and so is not in opposition to any basic Christian philosophy about God.  And as I pointed out, physicists and cosmologists do investigate what might have happened before the big bang.  It's not a scientifically meaningless question as this section is trying to claim.  And Kaku's description of the molecules in the jar not being moved, as I pointed out, is not motion from nothing.  The molecules had to have a probability or potential to move.  The reason things can move without another body moving them is they had a probability to move based on the uncertainty principle.  When you ask physicists why a particle just started moving or why for instance the particles are generated in a vacuum, they would say because of the uncertainty principle and the laws of quantum physics.  That's implying a cause.  There was a cause for the motion or the creation, not something out of nothing.  Now laws of physics and probabilities are not nothing.  And where did they come from?  Hawking I believe in a actual paper he wrote had the universe jumpstarted from a primeordial wave function, see Hartle-Hawking state, but where did that come from?  And this idea, as most ideas about the initial conditions of the universe, has been in no way accepted by all or even most scientists.  So unless it can be shown from a credible cited source that the vast majority of physicists and cosmologists hold that the cosmological argument has actually been scientifically refuted, not that they just don't personally accept it or something like that, we should not be making that claim.  For instance the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy makes no such claim, and has several pros and cons for the argument based on modern science, including the example of vacuum motion and vacuum genesis.  And as for popular science sources, Carl Sagan always held that the idea of a creator and generator of the universe had neither been proven nor disproven by science.",0

Does it still form H2, or more complex compounds?
Does it form compounds with any other elements?
What are its density, melting, and boiling points?
What does it take to convert it back to hydrogen?
Miscibility in solvents?
1) In addition H(1/n)2, where n is an integer > 1, representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing, it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals.
2) Hydrinos being a gas, there is no specific density it may have. Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures. The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures. It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place.
3) High energy radiation
4) Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances. Hydrinos, being a gas with an effective cross-section much less than ordinary than hydrogen, would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter, in such a manner that it will easily escape into space.

With all respect, I don't know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor, in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around.  I don't think this is the way to make people feel welcome on Wikipedia.  Chussid should not make personal attacks, but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history.  Any normal person in Chussid's position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks, which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed.   
Indeed. And the 'reasons' they give are totally outrageous. These same people DO consider www.truepeace.org which ALSO does not give any names or an address of the person(s) behind it a 'reliable source'. Because it fits in their Zionist thinking pattern. JAZ does not. If you ever wanted to know what Jews who oppose Zionism go through, you are having a nice view of it right now.

 Videology page deletion 

Hi there. This is regarding the deletion of the Videology article I posted yesterday. The reason given was because there was """"no explanation of significance."""" I was wondering if I could get more clarification.

According to A7 of the Criteria for Speedy Deletion article, an article must demonstrate why the subject is important or significant. It also states, """"The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible."""" In terms of credibility, it appears clear that the subject of the article has been covered by credible and reliable sources such as the New York Times and revered advertising and technology trade publications such as AdWeek and Tech Crunch.

As an aside, I'd be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles, such as TubeMogul, YuMe and Adap.tv. Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies, especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology.

I'm very interested in discussing this further with you and completely amenable with any suggested ways to improve the article on the subject matter.

Bad LOGIC

=Progressivism
On the progressivism and economic progressivism pages  some editors have deleted criticism on the following grounds.

1.  The article needs to be expanded first.
2.  The article needs to be improved first.
3.  Criticsm section puts undo weight on negatives.

Well I say this logic leads to only one outcome, the articles purpose is to argue the point which is a violation of NPOV.

1.  If the article needs expanding, expand it...criticism also helps expand.  THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title.
2.  The article is improved just by including a criticism section.  Again, THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title. Deleting the criticism on the grounds that the article needs to be improved suggests the only way to improve the article is by aruging the point. Again, violation of NPOV.
3.  Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts.
4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book.
5.  The addition of a pov original research counter arguement to the criticism further proves my point (And you can look on the history page) that they believe the purpose of the article is to argue the point rather than report the facts.

All were poorly reasoned excuses to delete material they objected to.  These editors are not trying to preserve the integrity of wikipedia or be """"Fair and balanced"""" they are simply trying to push a leftist political objective by censoring any alternative regardless of the source.

Classical Liberalism

Editor Slizor has deleted several sections and paragraphs which were cited and refrenced, including quotes from economists and think tanks on various things which Slizor has expressed disagreement with.  Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).

This is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.

The logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.  Slizor's edit needs a massive revert...and he needs to be drawn away from his computer and beaten with Milton Friedman and FA Hayek books until he understands the quotes from their books that he deleted.  ( )""",0

4efdfa5562ee13f0,"proposed deletion of sentence in intro 

This sentence appears in the introductory paragraph. I propose that it should be deleted on the grounds that it is neither a fair summary of Dr. Craig's theology nor does it contain any information which is sufficiently noteworthy to be included in the introductory paragraph. We've not mentioned Craig's debates in the introductory and the few comments about Molinism that he's made are in no way more significant than his debates. Also, the sentence is oddly written and may not make sense to a novice encountering these topics for the first time.

In theology he has also defended Molinism and the belief that God is, since Creation, subject to time.

In the interests of preventing the escalation of internecine conflict and ill-feeling between differing regional groups comprising the British Bangladeshi community, we hereby submit a list of requests for the administrators of Drishtipat London to implement. This should result in a more harmonious and co-operative environment in which DP London can hold conferences in Britain and continue it’s work in highlighting human rights abuses in Bangladesh and help make it a more effective organisation. Please signal your position regarding this communiqué. 

 
 

-The appointment of a British or Bangladeshi-born (Sylheti-speaking) Sylheti as executive of Drishtipat (DP) London. Thus accurately reflecting the overwhelmingly Sylheti character to the British Bangladeshi community and Sylheti concerns.

 

-An official statement of regret on the DP website that thorough research of the composition of the British Bangladeshi community was not initially undertaken. This oversight resulting in DP London conducting their campaign of 2006 on behalf of Dhaka-based garments workers. A worthy cause but one better suited for a DP Chapter whose constituency is less monolithic in it’s regional and cultural composition than Britain.

 

-Official confirmation that Faisal Ghazi (of Golmal blog fame) and Zubaer, DP members of ill-fame, have either been disciplined or preferably removed from DP’s campaigns. Their disparaging and outright racist remarks about British Sylheti’s on their blogs merits nothing less.

 

-The celebration of the achievements of ALL diaspora Bangladeshis. Not selected members such as author Tahmima Anam, (under the guise of concern for human rights) whom certain DP members may know from their time in Dhaka. This means the celebration of British Bangladeshi’s born and bought up in the UK as well, such as Rabina Khan and Abdul Ahad. 

 

-DP to become a genuine human rights organisation. This means concentration on bread and butter issues such as providing clean drinking water, inoculation and freedom from corruption and not 101 blog posts about the Awami League and the upcoming (irrelelevant) elections in Bangladesh. 

Drishtipat's greatest disservice to the Bangladeshi Human Rights/NGO sector is that they have made NGO work controversial by making it party-political. In Bangladesh anything deemed to be Pro-Awami League or Pro-BNP or Pro-Whatever useless party soon shrivells up and dies.",0

 Navigational template 

All the other topics have such things. So if there is a """"X and violence"""" article, there is usually a """"criticism of X"""" navigational template. As a sidebar, it does seems a bit pov-ish and non-WP:TOPIC since articles are often in a """"see also"""" type category rather than relating to the article at hand.   

That's my problem with them also. I think we should really get rid of all the criticism sidebars, all except for the the literary, film, etc, ones since criticism in those circles doesn't usually equate to 'very biassed'. It's almost as bad as putting articles on Christian violence under Wikiproject atheism (or vice versa, though I can't see it happening). When I see articles tagged that way I don't need to see anything else to know that somebody or other has a POV to grind and that the article is likely a mess.
  

 Teehan and Dostoevsky 

So the problem here is that we are mixing contemporary academics with great thinkers and writers and also putting Dostoevsky after Teehan when Dostoevsky clearly predated Teehan.  At the core of the problem is the fact that the question of whether Christianity is violent goes back further than Dostoevsky.  Thus, if we are going to use sources that are not from the last half of the 20th century, then we should frame the whole question as a much older debate involving philosophical perspectives such as Dostoevski's.
Note that I am not objecting to including Dostoevski; I'm just saying that we need to put him up against other great thinkers of a similar stature.  I'm thinking that there must be Enlightenment thinkers who would be good representatives of the critical side.

The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.

In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:

Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007

                           For not even death can do our loved ones apart;
                           The ones who were dear, the ones who were a part
                           Of our happiness and grief, of our rise and fall,
                           They will be resurrected whenever we recall!
            What would you not do to restore to life the ones you have lost to death? I am not talking about voodoo or some black magic. I am talking about obituaries. These are small memoirs or biographical sketches of the deceased ones which are usually published in newspapers. These may also be in the form of a notice about an upcoming funeral or death anniversary, with details about the subject.

            Death is a loss that cannot be reimbursed, but it is inevitable and it is the truth of life. One cannot escape it. So mourning it will only increase the pain. Instead, by reliving the good old times and cherishing the best of the memories, we can make the distant souls rest in peace. 
            They might have left never to return, but their memories are there to linger. An obituary is the only way of paying reverence and expressing our affection for them, to preserve what is left of them, to make them immortal. 
The advent of technology has made it even easier to make our tribute through online obituary services. Life goes on and for those who have an overly busy schedule; these services have proven to be a boon.
             Ideated and founded by Mr. Rajith Rajappan and his colleague Ruhee Sabins, Oobituary.com is one such site that allows you to upload pictures, visuals, audios and videos to your page apart from the text. It is a platform where people from all over the world come together and share their feelings in the memory of their lost beloved.

I can't believe that someone would perpetrate intentional vandalism on a site like this which really espouses the ideals of information sharing, open information exchange, and honor-system based knowledge transfer.

I don't take his vandalism on my work personally, but I do take offense to two things:
1) People like this undermine the spirit of something like Wikipedia, something that has the potential to change the way that people learn and to help everyone in society have access to all kinds of information, for free (not counting Internet access).
2) People like this have no respect for the sacrifices of our predecessors.  Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.  But people like Kanupur don't consider that, they only think of things selfishly.

Personally, I'm glad that he's been blocked, and I don't care if he gets in trouble at work because of his work's proxy being blocked.  In fact, I hope that they do figure out that he was a vandal on Wikipedia, and that that's why his work's proxy has been blocked from Wikipedia, and that he gets disciplined appropriately by his employers.",0

Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts). Also there is no requirement for the Finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in Åland.

@Hans Adler, truth and/or verifiability

Let's talk about truth and/or verifiability. You had corrected the name """"Stadtzeitung"""" we have in note #4 of this article into """"Stattzeitung"""", because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the """"truth"""" would now be, erroneously, """"Stattzeitung"""". A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)

But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for """"pseudo-science"""", """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the """"christians"""". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of """"pseudo-science"""" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?

Van Hooff is refered to as a """"Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands"""" in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called """"Professor Associate"""". Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a """"professor"""" on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of """"numerous books and articles"""" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?

Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most """"judges"""" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category """"Pseudowissenschaft"""" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they """"discovered"""" """"Van Hooff"""", taking him as """"proof"""", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is """"only"""" a quotation! ;-)

So much about verifiability and truth. The question of Pilate, BTW. —   """,0

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: """"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership.

Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in.

94e866e47f4d705c,"MSU Interview

Dear Samir,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

 I've seen this with other breeds abroad, unless some people pick them up and promote them, the kennel clubs just don't know they exist. Likewise, with academic studies. I have no idea what family/pack groups they create, or who or what they pack with. I've read a bit about feral dogs in general, and the material is against the idea of their packs. More often just pairs or small groups. This is why I asked. I don't know what IPD do naturally. Joing wolf packs does not sound right. Wolves are known to kill and eat domestic dogs.

893cca9f0f425aa4,"Due to continual nibbling away of information by some very uninformed editors the section on current legal battle makes absolutely no sense. It appears to be remnants of longer pieces of information standing in isolation. If anyone can work out there are two trials now in progress one which started in September 2012 at the Delhi Patiala Court heard by Mr Justice Akash Jain based on a FIR filed by the Delhi Police due to her fasting at the Delhi Jantar Mantar 6 October 2006. That trial has now completed two full days of hearings the next production warrant the 14th is set for October 30-31 2014 2 days of prosecution witnesses.
The second trial is in Imphal. So after her arrest on fresh charges March 2014 the Imphal Police pressed charges at that point a local corrupt lawyer turned up and decided that the best thing was for all charges to be dropped and Sharmila to be placed in a death tent where he desire to starve herself to death over a few weeks could be respected. The Chief Judicial Magistrate rejected his plea to dismiss all charges after 13 years of imprisonment because someone might ask why did you imprison her then and keep her in solitary if there was no case to answer. The lawyer then appealed to higher Court the District & Sessions Judge. When this Judge looked at the case he pointed out the prosecution hadn't actually submitted any evidence of any wrong doing other than suggesting that everybody knew she was on a fast to death. Given that following procedural rules of evidence in court no evidence was actually being presented just references to hearsay the Judge ruled that in the absence of positive evidence to suggest mens rea he didn't need to look into the validity of the actus reus of whether hunger striking was grounds for arrest under the attempted suicide legislation so he dismissed the charges adding that he felt the Government should take measures to preserve Sharmila's health because even if hte Prosecution hadn't bothered to present any evidence he knew she was on a hunger strike and would die without farther intervention. Subsequently the Government re-arrested Sharmila on a fresh charge of attempted suicide and appealed to the Manipur High Court to have the District & Sessions Judge's judgement overturned and for a trial to proceed. Meanwhile Sharmila is held at the JNIMS security ward (not house arrest because then she would be in her own home) on 15 day judicial remand. The last judicial remand renewal was 5th September (the next one is due on 19th September) the last hearing of the Manipur High Court regarding the judicial review of the previous case dismissal was 3 September when they sought more papers but it appears this is all to complicated for wiki editors so they have gone with what appear to be verifiable facts in no particular order which when read do not make any sense at all. In this they are true to the actual Indian court proceedings. Desmond Coutinho again look I have just signed my name.",0

Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

Detailed in the lawsuits www.disneylawsuit.com  filed in Federal court “PUBLIC RECORD” (2005 & 2006), and in various national and international news and press releases, state that in the early 1990's independent film maker Royce Mathew had pitched his original supernatural pirate story to the Walt Disney Company which is about “cursed pirates” of the Black Pearl pirate ship; pirates who don't want anything to do with the plunder/return a treasure because they are cursed, with effects of the curse they endure is fully revealed by moonlight and the gold medallion on a gold chain with mystic properties able to summon/call.  Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.

Then years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.  

During legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company.",0

My vote, incidentally, would be move to WNCI-FM.  Even though WNCI is unique among radio station call letters, that doesn't necessarily mean it's unique among encyclopedia subjects.

 Ahir-Yadava Connection 
Hi to all
It is sad to see so much of talk page wasted on a single point. People don't understand the problem and people have also failed to communicate the problem to users who are just schoolboys. Many of them are simply not aware that prior to being named yadav they were registered as Ahir in british census. so, instead of bringing yadava rulers of the past they need to show Ahir Yadava connection. Here is MSA Rao's statement on the subject-""""Historical & Semihistorical Evidences are available for equating Ahir with Yadava."""" . Boys you will do a great job if you just google, all the stuffs I had added in Ahir as Yadava section. 

One important observation in this regard is All historical yadavas found till date has been traced to abhira ancestry. historical Yadavas story bigins with Trikuta(800AD), who were Abhira. There is a very long gap between Yadavas of mythical era and those historians have traced so this would always be a matter of debate, and this has nothing to do with the arrival date of Abhira, because most of Hindu scriptures including Mahabharata has been written between 6th and 8th century AD, and are suspected to be backward projection. 

One important fact regarding Yadavas is that, though it means descent from Yadu, actually it means claiming Krishna lineage. Cult of krishna has no eveidence of existence before the beginning of the Christian era. so, dynasties had actually two kinds of claim, one from Krishna the God of Abhira, and another from Krishna the hero of Mahabharata. Again those who have adopted Krishna of Mahabharata did so only after it was written. These people are suspected to have styled on that line. There are Scholars(Check Rusell,B.V.) who believe Krishna of mahabharata is actually a cunning cruft of Brahmanas,and episodes related to him in Mahabharata are actually later days interpolations, done after stealing the god and philosophy of abhira tribe.

REVISED UPDATE: As far as I can tell, """"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"""" does not now appear on any list of anthems, national or otherwise. The links given above take you to List of anthems of UN member states, which has no mention of it, or National anthem, which has this little gem:
===For parts of states===
The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, amongst others, are notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" and these songs may be officially recognized.
14 of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union had their own official song which was used at events connected to that republic. The Russian republic used the USSR's national anthem. Some republics retained the melodies of those songs after the dissolution of the USSR (see the article National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics).
The United Kingdom's national anthem is """"God Save the Queen"""" but its constituent countries also have their own anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a number of songs which may be played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. The song usually played for England is """"God Save the Queen"""", though sometimes Jerusalem and Land of Hope and Glory may be played instead. Scotland has relatively recently adopted Flower of Scotland as its unofficial National Anthem, while Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century. Northern Ireland too has traditionally used """"God Save the Queen"""" though Londonderry Air is also used.
""""Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century"""", which is pretty good going - was it non-stop? No mention of the term """"national anthem"""" and the wording of the intro - notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" - plus the section heading """"parts of states"""" - clearly downgrades the status of Wales (and others). But my main concern is that our national anthem gets no recognition on a list, unless I've missed it; nothing showed on 'what links here'.   22:55, 4 September 2009""",0

 Hello Perrytrev, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to Framlingham College has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.

Maybe a """"purgatory in RC teaching"""" would be a good idea, maybe it would be a bad idea.  Right now, I'm just thinking about the audacious move, which I oppose for its own sake, other issues aside.  The move is a separate matter from the content, since everything about it was wrong.  As for you and I, I know we disagree on some things, but that's to be expected - people disagree.  In the end it probably makes a better article.  But neither you nor I have the desire to do anything disrespectful, audacious, or flagrantly inconsiderate.    

Well, two of our big things round these parts are Be Bold and Ignore all rules.  Which is to say, whether Abtract was bold and audacious or not, there's no sense stressing over spilt milk   we should make our decisions not based on the audaciousness of the action, but on the appropriateness of the outcome.   

I sort of have mixed feelings about the whole thing myself, but I'm content to let the experiment breathe for a while, because having two pages will forestall a more pointed content dispute.  Thus far, people have been pretty gentle with you and Lima, but many people (not me) are losing patience.  To have to pages is to avoid a content dispute that would be heated, but in which your POV would almost certainly wind up on the losing end.

So, even though I agree that the move was more bold than I myself tend to be, ultimately, I think it may be a good thing.    t""",0

Well, after quite a bit of training, I can now perform auto fellatio. However, with a penis size of below 6 inches, I could not by any stretch of the imagination describe myself as """"well-endowed"""". I don't use a """"front-bend"""" method either.

Its the position you'd take if you wanted to, for example, ejaculate down into your own mouth.

The part about being """"well-endowed"""" seems factually wrong, or at least a poor (ie very subjective) choice of words. Flexibilty is the main factor. Also, the topic seems to imply that this front-bend method is the only way. I've tried the front-bend but cannot quite do it.

The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same.

Thank you for your updates to the Wii article. However, I must point out a few things:

As referenced here: 480p, 720x480 and 640x480 are both 480p, the difference lies in what ratio a set or program is displayed in, 4:3 or 16:9, not what resolution. 480p, 720p and 1080p all refer to the vertical resolution, not the horizontal.
The Wii-mote's input is entirely different than the PS3 controller.  The PS3 controller's technology has been utilized in PC controllers for well over 10 years (the only difference is that the PS3's is apparently supposed to sense forward and backwards movement.)  The Wii-mote's nunhuck add-on has the same functions, but the remote itself has pixel-perfect pointing, the PS3 controller does not.
As for Wii=wee, that has no place in the article itself as it only furthers the problem.  The article references toilet humor and that should suffice for informing anyone new to the name that it may conjure up other meanings.",0

 Moline 2 

A few days ago I asked you why you reverted my efforts on the Moline, Illinois page and either I didn't get a response from you or I didn't receive it.  In your initial message to me, given at the time when you reverted all of the work I had done, you called my efforts vandalism and nonsense; I realize this is probably a auto-generated message sent in response to a flagged *accidental* event, but given that I've made several attempts to communicate to you, via this page as well as four or five times thru the original """"vandalism/nonsense"""" (to which to you responded *once*, with, I might add, a tone that was less than in keeping with the tone I see when I read the messages on this page).  Nevertheless, what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it  I had added the the Moline page a """"location"""", """"air travel"""", """"major interstate highways"""", """"sports"""", """"gambling"""", and """"landmarks; and notable bridges"""" sections.  Additionally, I completely revamped the schools section into an """"education"""" section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned.  You removed all of that.  BTW, I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page, so anyone could see what I was trying to do: make the Moline page better.  Before I found it, it was little more than a glorified rundown of which neighborhood has more Mexicans than the next... and I found it simply too racist to let stand.  Yes, I also was trying to edit the Neighborhood section, to remove the racism, but also better demonstrate the real flavor and history of the town.  Thanks to you, the history and flavor is gone, and the racism is back...  Congratulations.

0ea9d8ee0ef4a8c7,"""RfC: controversial multi-page move ==

 Summary by 89.101.221.42  

The issue is a recurring one. Proponents wanted:
 Ireland → Ireland (island) (or a variation)
 Republic of Ireland → Ireland (state) (or a variation)
 Ireland (disambiguation) → Ireland (or a variation)

Several different polls were opened simultaneously on (old page names):
 Ireland
 Ireland (disambiguation)
 Ireland disambiguation task force

A related poll had been run exactly one month earlier at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland

And one month before then again also at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland (archive)

Participation at the Ireland page was widest and consensus was against the move. Participation on two (recent) polls at the Republic of Ireland page also had wide participation and fell heavily against the move (both were closed). Participation at the disambiguation and task force pages were limited, but consensus in those polls came down (weakly) in favour of the move.

On this occasion the closing admin was:
 

Initially, Tariqabjotu performed the move request in error - having only seen the request at the task force page. When this was brought to his attention, he posted a response on this talk page. His decision was to maintain the move against consensus as consensus had arrived at """"an illogical conclusion"""" (which he linked to Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion). Later, he would comment that he had not read the discussions because, """"There's so much stuff to wade through..."""".

Issues believed to be at play:
 Forum shopping
 Vote stacking
 Consensus
 Polling is not a substitute for discussion

(Some) issues at play during the discussion:
 Disambiguation: Is there a primary topic?
 Naming convetions: Controversial names

89.101.221.42  
OBJECTION: What kind of 'summary' is this? The """"propenents wanted.."""" section above is selective.. where are the non-forked 'Ireland' options that opened the WP:IDTF taskforce? (ie Ireland as either state or island, but not both and not part of a dual state situation with Republic of Ireland??) The IP has ignored all the many main issues, and all the problems that have got us here, too.  Why are we letting this particular IP do this? I propose archiving this section, as it is clearly disrupting (and made to disrupt) the discussion and progress being made above it. He is spamming it all over Wikpedia too.  
I've moved the content discussion that was sidelined above this to the bottom of the page. This page will be unlocked soon, and it too important to ignore.   
Can we stop with the refactoring of the page? It isn't helping, it just makes it f-ing confusing as things flit around the page.

This is very anal-retentive and unimportant. I'm embarrassed to mention this, in fact, but I know Wikipedia is a stickler for formatting and facts.

The correct capitalization of my book is Reel V. Real, not Reel v. Real as listed in Works. (Please use a capital """"V."""" in Reel V. Real http://www.amazon.com/Reel-V-Real-Hollywood-Fiction/dp/0878332685/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1374239624&sr;=1-3&keywords;=frank+sanello

You are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. In your last revision of the article, you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists.

During our regular monitoring of social media and our internet reputation, members of the Marketing department at Raymond James noticed that much of the information on this page is outdated and/or incomplete.  We would like to take a more proactive approach to updating this information with current numbers, etc.  We are not sure who was responsible for originally writing the page, and we would like to make edits so that it reads less like a promotional piece/advertisement.

We would also like to put the following """"Controvery"""" section up for discussion.  This section was recently posted on the page, and reads unobjectively.  Many of the claims are not reliablity sourced, and the extensiveness of the section was disproportionate relative to both the size of our page and similar sections on competitors' pages.  We have left three of our majo/significant events on the page, and are including the smaller/unsourced claims here for discussion.  We are open to discussing how best to frame this section so that it reads more objectively.

Controversy

Raymond James has had been one of the most controversial firms with 49 regulatory events and 61 finalized arbitration's including housing several ponzi schemes according to Finra.http://brokercheck.finra.org/Support/ReportViewer.aspx In spite of all the controversy that surrounds Raymond James, the firm has been vocal about trying to prevent any increase in regulation of the financial services industry.http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0813601120101108 
Some of the most notable controversies have included:

In 1997, Charles LeCroy, a Raymond James banker, helped issue bonds in Jefferson County through a noncompetitive process. These bonds ended up funding corrupt activities and led to the county's bankruptcy.http://46in08.blogspot.com/2009/08/death-of-jefferson-county-alabama-and.html

In 2000, NASD regulators censured Raymond James & Associates, Inc. for “yield burning” activities on municipal securities. yield burning involves overcharges by brokerage firms on Treasury securities purchased with proceeds from the sale of municipal bonds. Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txt

In 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms. The minimal amount of due diligence conducted by the firm prevented them from discovering the fraud that was going on. The parent firm later went bankrupt causing millions in losses and one of the biggest fraud cases in the state of South Carolina.http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-02-05-homegold_x.htm

In 2003, Raymond James was found guilty of overcharging investors who made large purchases of mutual funds. There were nearly 160,000 trades that were overcharged and Raymond James had no systems in place to capture these trades.,http://www.txcm.com/reports/Raymond%20James%20mutual%20trading%20scandal.pdfhttp://registeredrep.com/institutions/raymondjames/finance_raymond_james_audits/

In 2005, the NASD fined Raymond James $750,000 for violations stemming from a failure to supervise the firm’s fee-based brokerage accounts.

In 2007, three ex-Raymond James employees sued, saying they were paid less than men and denied opportunities.http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/Women_claim_sex_bias_.shtml

In 2008, Jerry Rose was found to be conducting a ponzi scheme using Raymond James as custodian to the assets which amounted to over $16 million.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/story13.html

In 2008, Raymond James received lots of criticism for using obscure provisions under SOX in which they denied whistle-blowing claims on the basis that the claims were made against a subsidiary company.http://whistlersear.wordpress.com/tag/sox-whistleblower/ These laws were reversed when the new Frank Dowd act was put into place on July 21, 2010. Raymond James was mentioned as one of the companies that abused the laws, as a means to conduct ethical and legal grounds. This included the case of John Hughart v. Raymond James in which the complaints regarding lax supervision in compliance was overlooked on the grounds that the employee worked a a subsidiary and therefore had no opportunity for restitution from Raymond James.http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/SOX/2004/HUGHART_JOHN_v_RAYMOND_JAMES_and_AS_200",0

The .jpg extension is a good indication that the image is in the JPEG format. If you don't see file extensions on your computer (Windows XP hides them by default), you can always right-click on any image on a Web page and select """"Properties"""" or something similar; there should be a field in the Properties window called """"Location"""" or """"Address"""" or the like that will show you the URL of the image, which is http://www.doop.org/img/doop.jpg (as before, the .jpg extension is a good indicator that the image is a JPEG). So that original image is already compressed as a JPEG, and it will already have compression artifacts.
But that site doesn't seem to be an official Futurama site; it seems to be a fan site unrelated to Fox or any of its affiliates. So it's possible that there is an official Fox page that will have a PNG version of the DOOP logo (more likely you will find a GIF version, which can be losslessly converted to a PNG). But you'll have to do some searching. —  """,0

180d069a8d003ccc,"Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.128.240.229.3",0

Here's my thoughts on the deletion charges: Doughboy sounds like patent nonsense which is CSD#1. Category:World War II campaigns and theaters was a duplicate category. The policy on category deletion is still being discussed, but as far as I am aware, this is not a controversial deletion because you can't redirect categories, so empty ones already replaced by something else can only be deleted. The Conservative Party (UK), Hove and Herbert Stanley Morrison still exist, so perhaps these were only temporary deletes for page moves?

The problem with that, , is that according to nearly every account, Jesus's disciples believed he was the son of God. Even from a neo-skeptic's view, Jesus's disciples believed his teachings had some sort of meaning or authority. Our """"Jewish views"""" section would therefore claim: """"Some Jews believe Jesus is the son of God and the Messiah."""" While this is true, these Jews were/are often considered more Christian than Jewish. Jesus's disciples were Jews with Jewish views, but that was during a time period when Christians were counted among the Jewish sects.

A little background.
I have always loved languages. I am a native speaker of Arabic and English.
I have been dying to learn Hindi. Thanks to Wikipedia, I learned that Urdu would be a better place for me to start since I can already read the script.

However, I landed on the Retroflex consonant page when I could not read a few of the Urdu punctuation marks.

For me, the most glaring omission on the Retroflex consonant page is a small audio file so I can hear each sound. Telling me what it sounds like in a language I do not know (like Swedish or Polish) does not help. I was able to copy some words to Google Translate and listen to them there but that was of limited use.

I see that other articles have sound, video and animation so I do not think this would be a technical problem.

df0e68ecd04e1db4,"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination
Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. 

Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.",0

What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included. Whatever the reasons for the choice of articles, the failure to include major younger figures associated with the New Complexity seriously skewed this entire """"Forum.""""

Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.

I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.

 A request 

I ask that you consider taking time away from posting on WT:V or the subpage. Your posts there, particularly the multiple polls, became disruptive several weeks ago, and the page has basically ground to a halt because of it. I took six weeks off from editing either the policy or the talk page—from around June 20 until August 7—just to make sure other people's voices were heard equally, so I hope you'll consider doing the same. If your proposals are truly supported, they won't be affected by your absence.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I agree that the main talk page needs a breather from this whole topic.  And I'm ready for quiet work on it in an obscure place for a while.  If you want that to not be the subpage, that's fine with me but I just said there that I went along with the subpage idea.  Sincerely,  North8000  

The main talk page needs a long, long breather. But I think you need a breather too from this topic, partly for your own sake, but also to see whether it has legs without you. At things stand, you're doing two things simultaneously (and in something of a contradiction): keeping it going, and strengthening opposition to it because of the overkill. If you would let it be, you would see whether it has legs of its own. Anyway, just a request.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I'm ready to slip into low key """"homework"""" on this, even without a request.  Me suggesting that we adopt the first sentence just proposed/suggested by Jimbo Wales was a sort of special departure from that, I saw that as acting more as a facilitator.  I noticed that somebody tried to hide the fact that it was HIS suggestion by changing the section title. North8000  

But not before reverting and continuing to disrupt. You are posting an inherently POV poll; RfCs are supposed to be neutrally worded. I give up on you because it is pointless.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

 I don't think that it is POV to say who wrote the proposed wording.  That was the original title of the section, it's the title that people commented under, and it provides the information of who wrote it.   Since when in Wikipedia does saying the source of something get called """"POV'ing"""" it? And don't forget there is a second dimension to this.  I put up HIS suggestion, and people are removing the fact that it was HIS suggestion simultaneously with villianizing me for putting (it) up a suggestion on the first sentence.  I call that dirty pool.  But, as I said, I put it it up as a facilitator, and don't plan to further advocate it.  North8000  """,0

 One small nit pick- 

In this paragraph:

A minority of theorists, such as Wendy B. Faris, argue that certain films, such as The Witches of Eastwick and Field of Dreams could be described as magical realist, but the term is still primarily used to describe literature.
However, if one accepts movies as a possible medium for magic realism, one should have a look at many of the movies of Tim Burton (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish) or David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart).
Other examples: La cité des enfants perdus, What Dreams May Come, Adaptation and Being John Malkovich.

These following movies (listed above) are BASED ON BOOKS:
The Witches of Eastwick, Field of Dreams and What Dreams May Come.

It's also silly to wonder if movies can be magical realist, esp if it's based on books that are magical realist books.

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 
Report to a Chair:

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) 

Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0

Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%. According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture, doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken.

Yes. I wasn't denying that that was a consequence, but I just think to mention that but not the occupation is a major oversight.

That has been the source of conflict for over 40 years, with incalculable repercussions. I suggest adding after the above sentence:

 """"Another lasting consequence of the war that has had enormous repercussions and which helped establish the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, which continues to this day.""""

Each in turn

Suggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull.
The addition of """"and"""" is good. However, a force need not be """"perceived"""" to exist. The definition of """"acceleration"""" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.
Provide definition: """"momentum (quantity of motion)""""
Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.
Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the """"force"""" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
There is a slight issue here with the sentence: """"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions."""" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a """"force"""" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.

I will implement the wording I think is good, but let's keep discussing the problematic wording.

Hi.  The original """"Land Of Confusion"""" song/video were in existence for 2 decades before Disturbed decided to cover it.  Adding such an overwhelming amount of info on Disturbed's cover version distorted readers' analysis of the original song/video. (For what it's worth, I personally don't even care for Genesis at all, nor do I have any special fondness for this song/ video, though the video's puppetry was fairly innovative in its day.)  But I & others felt the article was being pillaged by Disturbed fans, and thus Wikipedia was being compromised in the process.  The article is much more fairly balanced now, and gives appropriate coverage to Disturbed's version.  So I have no regrets about how I edited it, nor do I have a problem with what you added back, since I think you added back a judicious amount... though the huge Infobox is pushing things a bit. (I only made that one edit to the article & had forgotten all about it until just now.) As user Robotman1974 posted back on Jan. 16th, """"Right now the word counts of the main parts of the Genesis version vs the Disturbed version are 775 to 996 respectively.""""  So you see, the word count (showing clear bias in favor of Disturbed's version over the original version) is what motivated my pruning.  I do welcome your further thoughts on this, though, since I realize Disturbed probably spent a lot of time and money on making that video, & they are a bit more highbrow than most """"nu-metal"""" bands of today. And I agree with you that their cover version is more notable than most, since theirs did very well on the charts (though I never even knew theirs existed until I stumbled onto this article).  The only recourse that would make both sides happy is to make an entire new article devoted to Disturbed's version. I would be in favor of that; this would allow you to add back all the info I deleted initially.

Best, and good luck in the governor's race,

 Josef Rosch Image deletion 

Hi,
I uploaded File:Josef Rösch.jpg for an article on Josef Rosch. It was tagged for speedy deletion because of some sort of """"copyright infringement."""" However, I replied that not only do I have permission from the copyright owner (Dotter Institute) but that I can provide it if necessary. So, why was the file deleted and how can I avoid getting it deleted in the future?

My plan is actually to use a different, higher quality photo. I also will have copyright authority for this image. What sort of documentation do you want to prevent a deletion? Thanks for your time. 
 You had put an absolute minimum of effort into preparing the image description:
 {{Information |Description = Photo of Josef Rösch |Source = Available online |Author = Dotter Institute |Permission = Evidence: Will be provided on request. }} ==Licensing== Free use for wikipedia.
 Description - could have linked to the article about the guy. """"Available online"""" - disgusting - provide a link to it! """"Will be provided on request"""" - no! - evidence must be provided at the time of upload. """"Free use for wikipedia"""" - hopelessly vague - we need a proper Creative Commons licence.

I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic, then we can go with that. The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church. Williamson, in his association with the SSPX, was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic, even while not in full communion. Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a """"Catholic rite"""". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession. My suggestion for a succinct description of Cox would be """"Independent Catholic bishop"""", as that is how his church is described.   """,0

1f70f348c3dae2cc,"""
First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as """"keep"""" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).

As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form """"keep, I believe this subject is notable"""" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  """,0

 Copy of email sent to ARBCOM in relation to sockpuppet debacle 

Hi,

First off, my username on WP is Russavia and is in relation to user FayssalF

It is with regret that I am bringing this case to ARBCOM. I want it to be known that I hold no grudge against FayssalF but feel that for the best interests of the overall project that I have to bring this request here. As this involves one of your own, I know there is going to be a desire to write off anything I may have to say, and possibly use the filing of this report against myself in another report I will be filing and directly related to this. I do hope that members of ARBCOM can view this without bias.

I was blocked by User:Moreschi due to alleged harrassment of another editor. What brought this accusation of harrassment up was due to:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Serious_ban_request

After a two week block which I received (and will be addressing separately), Fayssal proceeded to do a check-user on myself and User:Miyokan which he announced here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Russavia.2C_confirmed_sock_of_Miyokan.3F

An admin, User:Tiptoety then proceeded to indef block both myself and Miyokan on case of being sockpuppets (Miyokan as being one of my socks).

I attempted to have this sockpuppet block removed on account of providing my IP address in an open fora, so that editors/admins could see that I was in Perth (Western Australia), whereas Miyokan was in Nizhniy Novgorod (Russia). These attempts were denied due to the check-user that had been performed by Fayssal. A check-user which he himself confirmed the results of in that thread above. I proceeded to send an email to Miyokan (for only the 3rd time that I can remember we have ever had a direct discussion) in order to talk to him about this. In the meantime, Fayssal had posted a message to my talk page which in effect stated that Miyokan being in Nizhniy Novgorod is not the case, and that I should know this as both Russavia and Miyokan are in Australia.

When discussing with Miyokan not long after I sent the email, I found out that he was in fact located not in Nizhniy Novgorod, but in Adelaide (South Australia). After that, I then became aware of the message Fayssal left on my TP; and I responded to the effect that the results of the check-user should be revealed, as I know I am in Perth, and I know that Miyokan is in Adelaide (but did not mention Miyokan's location due to privacy).

Luckily, and thankfully, I was able to convince Miyokan to place his IP on his talk page, with a note to say it is for my use. I then posted both IPs on my talk page, and provided the relevant links to check them (www.network-tools.com and www.geohacks.com) and that would reveal that we are not in the same location, and hence not the same user.

Fayssal said that he tried but was getting timeout messages and would look again. Whilst all of this is happening, discussions is still going on at the Admin noticeboard, and nothing short of Wikimurder was going on - a fact I pointed out to Fayssal at the time.

Eventually Fayssal came back and confirmed that what was being said all along my myself was in fact the truth. He placed a notice on my talk page with an apology. This and my response can be found at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Russavia#Unblocked_and_apologies

I responded to this stating that the apology would be wholeheartedly accepted once a similar apology was made to Miyokan, as the community has already dealt with his previous use of two accounts - which stopped immediately when he was alerted to it being a no-no. And I stand by the comments there. And yes, I am still willing to accept the apology so long as Miyokan also receives the same apology, as both of our accounts were unneedlessly dragged thru the mud, and if the accusation can be made jointly, then so should the apology.

That's the background. Now here's the problem.

What has occurred here is a total breakdown in admins doing check-users or the check-user system itself is horribly flawed and needs to fixed. This does not take into account our totally different style, completely different editing subjects, with little or no interaction, etc - this episode should be directly mentioned at WP:DUCK as a prime example as to why WP:DUCK is inherrently flawed.

Consider this one question. If I was not able to convince Miyokan to reveal his IP, where would we be at now? That is the question that needs to be considered in conjunction with the fact that a Geo-IP check is a simple operation, an internet novice is able to do it. How is it that Fayssal was not able to immediately determine upon doing a check-user that both Miyokan and myself",0

f290884e72efefe6,"This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale's improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.

This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.

Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  
“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”
I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) 
The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle.

 Spin Triplet/Singlet Redirects. 

Hi. It doesn't make sense to redirect """"singlet state"""" and """"triplet state"""" to an article in chemistry which actually *uses* singlet and triplet states. The chemistry article is an application of singlet and triplet states, and not a proper description of the actual (*quantum-mechanical*) phenomenon.

Please stop with the redirects. There is *NO* justification for them. Spin singlets or triplets are a QM phenomenon, and should thus be discussed in a physics context. If you wish to add a section """"for chemists"""" to the relevant (physics) pages, feel free to do so. 

PS: Pardon the incorrect use of your talk page earlier. My mistake.

 Etymology 

The etymology section was completely wrong. The Hebrew consonant """"Tsade"""" results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as """"Ṣad"""" and """"Ḍad"""". It is easy to see that """"chamets"""" corresponds to the Arabic root ḥ-m-ḍ, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is ḥamiʕa (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic """"Ḍads"""" map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both """"sour"""" and """"leavened"""" (cf. """"chamuts"""" =sour; """"chomets"""" =vinegar; """"chumtza"""" =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote """"sour"""" or """"acidic"""". In any event, """"chamets"""" is not related to """"hummus"""" or """"Homs"""". """"Hummus"""" is """"chimtza"""" in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, """"chometz"""" in the Bible might be """"hummus"""" rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape. 79.177.167.209  """,0

Completely reverting all my useful comments based on firsthand knowledge of the diet and its effects on my health did not seem helpful at all, since you decided you knew better.  Do you have any knowledge on this subject?  If so, please inform me.  Do you have cancer?

Also, please explain, for example, why """"proponents"""" of Budwig's diet mention 6 or 7 Nobel Prize nominations when 7 nominations are clearly stated on the book's cover but you reverted this completely to make it sound suspect to another person's account that apparently has none of the doctor's books and is operating from internet anecdotes as valid citations.  The truth is that """"critics"""" (apparently existing mainly on Wikipedia) have issue with the book's statement, yet this fact could not be allowed to stand, even though the un-updated online source was left intact.  This """"Nobel Prize"""" section of the article is actually useless and did not exist in earlier versions; it should be deleted outright.

Finally, please tell me what references you expect to corroborate the minimal extra information I included (they information is contained in the her two primary books: """"Oil-Protein Diet"""" and """"Flax Oil as ..."""").  If you knew anything about the diet, you would find what was reported in this so-called encyclopedic entry embarrassing.  My point was to improve it so that other cancer sufferers would not be mislead into thinking this diet is some half-baked diversion and would seek out the books and learn more.  Please tell me what your objective is and why.

I'm sure you might already know that Wikipedia has a bad reputation when it comes to objectively reporting health information that conflicts with so-called mainstream approaches.  One full-time industry plant who was monitoring/editing Wikipedia articles (like this one) has already been exposed.

In any case, I hope your original offer was actually """"help"""" as you stated and maybe this article can be improved by both of us.  My suspicions were high coming into this proposed revision and when I saw immediate reversions, you can imagine my concern that all I heard was true.

18-ethoxycoronaridine
Hi Edgar. Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   
The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) 
Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   
Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds",0

Further edits have persisted adding """"citation needed"""" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes.

I was just reading through the very intelligent commentary here and it occurred to me - why don't we arrange by decade?

 Paragraphs vs section headers 

Sorry, didn't mean to imply it didn't have """"merit"""", any good faith edit on Wikipedia has merit. What I'm saying is, section breaks and paragraph breaks are similar, the question is when to use one vs the other. Paragraph breaks provide logical breaks in the content. In this case there is a new section header at the top of almost every paragraph, which is redundant, that's what paragraphs are made for. By adding those section headers, I believe, it chops up the article which discourages reading it as a single block of text from top to bottom, and encourages skimming and skipping, like reading an outline that hasn't been filled in, or a """"list of"""" sort of thing, rather than a chronological and somewhat inter-related history of the origin of the high five. If we thought those origin theories were going to be greatly expanded.. say 4 or 5 or more paragraphs each.. I could see section headers making more sense, but until then, I believe it reads better as a single block of text. Green Cardamom (talk) 
I see what you're saying, but I disagree. I think it looks better the way it is now, especially with the long block quote in the first section. I mean, the other option to me is bullets, but I think we both would agree that's not that aesthetically pleasing. Without some kind of division, it makes it harder to see that the three options are mutually exclusive, or arose independently at best. Without the divisions, in my opinion, it sounds like one origin narrative that all together led to the high five, rather than three separate possibilities.   """,0

I blieve the translation from the press office is very good. For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  

 Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use 

I would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is
The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.
While the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:
Any war could and should be categorised as an """"atrocity"""" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....
Unverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.
...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.
While it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.
Directly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

The countries were illegally annexed, and there is a considerable difference between de facto and de jure; if I steal your car and then forge the title, it may be """"my car"""" in that I drive it, register it, paint it hot pink and invite my relatives to live in it, but a Wikipedia article on the matter would probably best be entitled """"Theft of Dojarco's car.""""  The article on O.J. Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the """"lameness"""" of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this.

Elementary algebra may explains to readers certain core complex number ideas quite well, but I only put it out there for discussion.  Argand diagrams made complex numbers respectable.  These diagrams are metaphors, far from exact ones, of the imaginary field, yet appear in the article. Imaginary numbers are not yet points.  Keith Devlin wrote """"since the complex numbers are not points on a line, you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger; for the complex numbers there is no such notion."""" Yet he also stated """"There is, however, a notion of size of sorts.  The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number."""" [Devlin, Keith, The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible Macmillan, 2000: 133.} Desmond Fearnley-Sander explains that """"From a geometric point of viuew, complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors."""" [Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, Plane Euclidean Reasoning, in Automated Deduction in Geometry, 2nd International Workshop, ed. Gao, X, et. al,  Beijing, China 1998, Google eBook: 108] They're the clock hand that points to the hour, not the hour point. 

Consistent with this logic, it's better to consider the plane rotating under the complex vector than the vector itself.  This sidesteps the variability of complex number position: its the plane's fault, if you will.  Want this grounded in mathematical foundations?  Look no further than the Riemann hypothesis.

Riemann extended Euler's zeta function, which Euler developed to find prime numbers, to define complex numbers.  Riemann's wanted to prove Euler's conjecture, which he attacked by solving complex solutions to f(zeta) = 0.  Riemann found x + iy, where x lies between 0 and 1, has infinitely many solutions.  He proposed they all (except negative even integers) are of form 1/2 + iy.  Computer tests find the first 1.5 billion f(z) = 0 (called z(s)) solutions lie on the line x = 1/2 in the complex plane.  But inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything, and the Riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.

The only singularity of z(s) is the simple pole at s, or 1. There is no reason to assume complex numbers are points.  I don't believe this is non-standard. It is profound and documented.

 The precise definition of race is under dispute 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0

I do not agree with  your close of Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Article Incubator/Marie Charlotte de la Trémoille which I think a classic supervote. There were 4 opinions: the nom's opinion to delete as a stale draft, another editor's opinion to delete because of questionable notability and a stale draft , my opinion to redirect to the apparent subject of the article, and a keep opinion that the subject was notable and that the user thought it could be worked on further, and had a source available.

You decided to delete, admitting that """"this may not look like the right result"""", based on your view that   1/""""it was extremely unlikely that a redirect would help find the associated article""""  perhaps, but it would help the user find at least some information on the named person 2/""""the incubator was a bad idea, 3/there was a user willing to work on it you would undelete  but there wasa user willing to work on it. 

As you didn't delete it, someone placed a speedy on it, which is reasonable of them, but I boldly reversed it while I ask you to reconsider. (If you   hold by your decision & want to revert me, I will not consider it wheel-warring in this circumstance)  Your reasons, 1/ is misconceivedthe pt of the redirect is to find some info on the named subject, which is present in the article redirected toit at least identifies the person 2/your personal opinion that an accepted feature of WP should be closed down, and 3/ the distinction you drew between someone who might work on it and someone who could. 

Since you said, """"if there is a user willing to work on it you would be happy to move it, please  either relist for further discussion,  move it to my user space or that of FactS[pace. or redirect as I suggested.

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.

I'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better. Thanks.  """,0

"""" Some pundits have suggested that whereas there have been two elections in less than two years, parties will be weary of voter fatigue and avoid causing an early election, however, the lessons of the minority governments of the 1960s suggest this will not be the case.""""

This isn't an acceptable passage - it's purely speculative and unsourced. If a pundit says something then quote him or her or paraphrase and footnote. 

And what are the lessons of minority governments of the 1960s? This seems like original research (as well as quite incomplete). If there's a lesson then quote someone who has said what it is. Please, no more unsourced claims or references to anonymous gatherings of pundits.  """,0

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0

In the UK, people often enquire about nationality not knowing themselves exactly what the Hell they mean; ask me, I've been there thousands of times. As for """"Citizenship means Nationality"""", that too is inaccurate. Citizenship is merely one form of that type of nationality (legal individual status -  the second description). There are atleast four other strands of nationality which are not citizenship; whoever acquires what is down to the circumstances. Finally, if as you say, the English language nationality means legal status, why apply it to a politician? Where is the sense in a Swedish citizen/national running affairs in Malta? Unless he were Maltese by some form of documentation, there would be a conflict of interest. And even if you can answer that one, perhaps you should check Ibrahim Rugova, remember him?

I thought the bahavior of the police were disgusting, yet later I saw the same footages and photos of those polices on the internet, but the description is that those police beating and protests were actually happening in Nepal and not in Tibet.

Dear EDJohnston and Bearian, I am not here to harm any one or to put any unnecessary information in Wikipedia pages.
Here in UST Global wikipedia page I update the latest information regarding UST Gloabal so that wikipedia users get the right information under right category.

1) Under Corporate Milestones: Company achievements needs to be listed.
2) The link http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931 may have the recent major information about UST Global, but the top part of the page that mentions about """"Key Executives"""" is totally wrong. Two people and their postions who are not part of UST Global is being mentioned here.
3) UST Global is a Company where in past there may have a lot of people who were part of this company in key roles/posts (during their asscociation with the company their names may have been part of this Company related records), but once they left this company searching for other oppurtunities i dont understand why they want to mention their name associated with UST Global. This is like self advertisement which is totally against wikipedia policy

Please advice me if i am wrong in my understanding.

Thank you,

 Motto of the day 

Hello, I notice you're using one of the  templates, run by Wikipedia:Motto of the day. You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply """"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"""". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I've been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren't enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.

When you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That's it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they've got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.

If you have any questions, please let me know, or post on the project's talk page. I'm looking forward to reading your comments on the suggested mottos, and any additional suggestions you'd like to make. Until then, happy editing!  (//c) """,0

Salam, I'm quite sure the two paragraphs below refer to Salafi defined by the 2nd bullet point ... 
Many others exclude the Muslim Brotherhood [9][10]and Deobandi [11][12] since they believe these groups commit (bid'ah), or worse. 
... and not the first, but I will have to do more research to nail this down.  

Salafis place great emphasis on ritual not only in prayer but in every activity in life - three fingers should always be used when eating, water is to be drunk in three pauses with the right hand while sitting [13], making sure their galabea or whatever garment they wear does not extend below the ankle[14]  so as to follow the example of Muhammad, the Sahaba (the first generation of Muslims), the Tabi‘in (the second generation), and the Taba‘ at-Tabi‘in (the third generation)[citation needed] and make religion part of every activity in life.

Salafism differs from the earlier contemporary Islamic revival movements of the 1970s and 1980s commonly referred to as Islamism, in that (at least many) Salafis reject not only Western ideologies such as Socialism and Capitalism, but also common Western concepts like economics, constitutions, political parties, revolution and social justice. Muslims should not engage in Western activities like politics, """"even by giving them an Islamic slant."""" [15] Instead, Muslims should stick to traditional activities, particularly Dawah. Salafis promote Sharia rather than an Islamic political program or state.  21:35, 7""",0

 Advice on Portal:Jurassic Park: 

Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:

1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.
2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of """"no opinion"""". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.
3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.

So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  """,0

4f4c08dad1cc7c2d,"Apologies

I never got back to you properly about Wynton and Haydn and now I fear I never will: sorry. Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece. LOTS of non-classical-specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school! ) I'm sorry to do this to you as you now won't have a chance to argue with me, but it's the best I can manage right now.

It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was """"27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in."""" (p. 321).

 non-NPOV + inaccurate information

Reasons for removal:

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith. 

 The phrase """"most shia"""" does not cite any authority or text and could therefore be completely fabricated. Not to mention that there are over a dozen subsects among the shi`a.

 """"sad examples of what happens"""" <- that's a non-NPOV (non-Neutral Point Of View)

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

The lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well, it should be much longer based on the article's current length, it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry-picked county data, per WP:NPOV. It needs to give a concise overview of the topic, rather than focusing on too many examples, to avoid clutter. 82.8.252.13  """,0

Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view demands both stories side by side
That means both the terror terror story and that what actually happened. This also means there is no need to continue the debate about terror, as it is much more important to get the whole secondary explanation on the page.

Wikipedia:Cite_sources
Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

Here are some references:

[]
Why the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Won't Go Away makes it clear there are 2 mainstream views that should be displayed side by side attributing as much hardcoded quotations as possible. 

[]

[]
Around 75 top professors and leading scientists believe the attacks were puppeteered by war mongers in the White House to justify the invasion and the occupation of oil-rich Arab countries.

Unless anyone has a good reason not to add those to the page and not to mention this documented information?

William Rodríguez RICO lawsuit
In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and others, including a total of 100 defendants, together with Ellen Mariani and lawyer Phil Berg. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate. Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms Let the facts speak for themselves..

Wikipedia:No original research

As long as it's not in a peer review journal kerosene cant melt reinforced steel. 
Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words

Hiding all the evidence incriminates the Bush administration. Further evidence of anything is just weasel wording. Hijackers, fires, explosions, demolition all perfectly good to describe the story.

P.S. In response to 'canvassing': I think such accusations are, once again, biased. We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it, but nothing happens, because she is supporting the status quo. Canvassing for the status quo=acceptable. Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I'm being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn't know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field. Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia, but society itself.

Finally again, FYO I am more than two, but slightly less than three, standard deviations above the 'average' IQ, and therefore I see fit to say that I, like Michael C Price, and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society. Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average, we can still see the groundwork of 'one' order of magnitude higher. Of course, an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user, so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system, which I see as having quite many flaws. I do hope that these types of 'essays' will lead to 'constructive' improvements in the future.

ab457bd31bf10b60,"""One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

 [edit conflict]

 Some good points, which require more thought.  Some initial responses: 
 I don't think """"Ukraine in WWI"""" is suitable, because most of the activity discussed in the article wasn't directly concerned with the war, and the period covered doesn't correspond to the duration of WWI (1914–1918). 
 """"Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire"""" would be better, but it only defines the period in question by what it followed. In contrast, """"in the Russian Revolution"""" is associated with the events covered herein.
 I agree that """"History of Ukraine (1917-1922)"""" is the most neutral, but that is simply because it avoids saying what the article is about. I think readers appreciate being given a clue to the subject of an article when they see the title in isolation.  It would also be good to have a title which can at least occasionally be linked directly, rather than always having to type a piped link: [[History of Ukraine (1917-1922) |Ukraine in the Russian Revolution]].

 The first revolution of 1917 is what starts the events here, and Russian Revolution or Russian Civil War can refer to the greater events up to 1921.  I also think this article requires an earlier section covering events from the 1905 Revolution, but that will take a bit of reading first.

 Is it a problem to associate a Ukrainian history article with the Russian revolution in the title?  Personally, I think it's neutral because it doesn't imply that Ukraine was Russian, but merely refers to the defunct Russian Empire.

 But as I wrote above, you make some good points.  I'd like to get some more input from other editors. — Z. 2006-10-30 03:34 Z""",0

1. It was the first presidential election in which the national ticket was nominated in conventions. The Anti-Masonic, National Republican, and Democratic Parties held national conventions. 

2. One of the major issues was nullification (the idea that states could 'nullify' or veto congressional legislation). Calhoun refused to run with Jackson for this reason, and South Carolina entered a brief anti-Democratic phase. Calhoun resigned as VP, the first person to do that, and became an anti-administration U.S. Senator. 

3. Another major issue was the National Bank. Clay forced a vote on extending the charter of the Bank in the summer of 1832. Jackson vetoed it. Clay felt that the Bank would be critical to economic development. Jackson did not have a specific policy - Van Buren later created the independent treasury system which laid the groundwork for the banking system which is still in place.",0

CJ DUB Keeps Calling Users Ignorant - Violation of Wiki Rules
Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor """"with experience"""". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american """"man"""" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki. 
As a result of the above valid points, I urge blocking him for a long while so he learns to respect others on this forum. Again, he's broken wiki rules on respect for others 3 times. Thank you.

There are only two ways to write months: long form, and short form.
Long form: Months мај, јун, јул, maj, jun, jul + јуни, јули, juni, juli (besides other 9+9 i.e. 18 ones) all belong in long_months. That’s resolved.
Short form: short_months must all have dot (they’re all the dotted short names) except famous 6 (or 10 if you count јуни, јули, juni, juli which are variants for јун, јул, jun, jul, respectively). We don’t use """"мај."""", """"јун."""", """"јул."""", """"maj."""", """"jun."""", """"jul."""" because there are already existing long forms in that shape (""""мај"""", """"јун"""", """"јул"""", """"maj"""", """"jun"""", """"jul""""), and if we abbreviate """"јуни"""", """"јули"""", """"juni"""", """"juli"""" as """"јун."""", """"јул."""", """"jun."""", """"jul."""" we did it illegally because there are already """"јун"""", """"јул"""", """"jun"""", """"jul"""" as long forms that cannot be abbreviated (and are used in Serbian much much more often than јуни, јули, juni, juli).
So, yes: dot is ALWAYS required for short month names except for my famous 6 with extra 4 mentioned above (famous 10 in total).

What you’have presumed is almost 100% correct, and code above should be actually 100% correct. Taking into account my two definitions above for long form and short form it’s like this, I suppose:
 long names of varying lengths; not shortened versions
local long_months = {['јануар']=1, ['фебруар']=2, ['март']=3, ['април']=4, ['мај']=5, ['јун']=6, ['јуни']=6, ['јул']=7, ['јули']=7, ['август']=8, ['септембар']=9, ['октобар']=10, ['новембар']=11, ['децембар']=12, ['januar']=1, ['februar']=2, ['mart']=3, ['april']=4, ['maj']=5, ['jun']=6, ['juni']=6, ['jul']=7, ['juli']=7, ['avgust']=8, ['septembar']=9, ['oktobar']=10, ['novembar']=11, ['decembar']=12};

 short names all three characters; these do not use terminal period
local short_months = {['мај']=5, ['јун']=6, ['јул']=7, ['maj']=5, ['jun']=6, ['jul']=7};

 short names all three characters; these require terminal period
local dot_months = {['јан']=1, ['феб']=2, ['мар']=3, ['апр']=4, ['авг']=8, ['сеп']=9, ['окт']=10, ['нов']=11, ['дец']=12, ['jan']=1, ['feb']=2, ['mar']=3, ['apr']=4, ['avg']=8, ['sep']=9, ['okt']=10, ['nov']=11, ['dec']=12};

Only changes are extra , ['јун']=6 and , ['јул']=7 for local long_months, and is_valid_month_range_style() should do the job perfectly.

It can be equaled to December–June 2014 which might be December 2013 – June 2014 or December 2014 – June 2015. Winter–Spring 2014 is still ambiguos in my opinion, and dates for solstices and eqinoxes don’t change that by  values they have at the moment (which are going to change in the very far future because Earth does not travel along the same path every year; it changes for sure but for 10–I don’t know really meters). At that time, we won’t be on modules I hope.    04:54, 11""",0

I can see now that nothing I say will be read as sincere. I'm sorry that this is the case. I really was trying to help things. I felt that if I told you my side of things you might understand me better. I wasn't trying to lecture you. I really feel like I have been attacked from the beginning. Whether or not you think it is correct isn't really the issue. It is the way I feel. If you think through how things have happened you will see that it is a pretty legitimate feeling. We both reverted three times (I counted). If you want to call me the bad guy for reverting, then call him the bad guy too. If you want to accuse me of being disrespectful, show me where. I wasn't disrespectful until the point at which you reverted my suggestion, yet you accuse me of being disrespectful before that point.

Basically, if you're going to start off accusing me and not caring about my view of the situation, then what hope do I have of having my POV appreciated in the consensus? None! The mediator of the discussion is already convinced I'm in the wrong. You can delete this if you want, but I hope you read it first. I'm not trying to point fingers!! I'm just trying to help you understand...

From my view, you felt like you needed to step in and help with an edit war. You set some ground rules and are trying to establish a consensus. You saw me and thought I was adding something questionable to the article. You reverted it, thinking the article would then be in its original state. (This wasn't the case. My edit was the original.) You somehow saw my edits as disrespectful. You saw my change as a deliberate attempt to violate consensus when I thought it was a step in the right direction. I saw someone chide me in all caps and reacted defensively, pretty natural reaction, right?

Neither of us are in the wrong here, or both of us are.

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

Moneybomb (money bomb, money-bomb, fundraising bomb, Fawkes bomb) is a neologism used to describe a grassroots effort to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing and concentrating the candidate's fundraising activity during a specific hour or day. The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidate's notable success, if any.
The term was used as early as 2004, but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States, with its record-breaking fundraiser of November 5. The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates.

Origin
According to The Politico, the term was coined in 2007. The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th, Guy Fawkes Day. This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film, V for Vendetta, which depicted a modern-day fascist Parliament, overpowered by popular revolution that was led by """"V"""", a Fawkes-like character.

The 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented one-day online fundraiser in political history, bringing in over $4 million. On November 6, Ron Paul's campaign stated that in addition, the free media coverage after the event was worth well over $10 million.

The imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged, since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system, but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government, so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous. Paul's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton clarified to the New York Times that Paul does not support blowing up government buildings: """"He wants to demolish things like the Department of Education . . . but we can do that very pea",0

 Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) 

Hi there, in regards to Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park), please do not re-insert that information into the article, as it fails verification. The source which was used states:

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy. It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police. The victims themselves were permanently traumatised: women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as """"the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist"""".

It does not state WHICH memorial, and the inclusion in this article represents original research. As a Berliner, you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials, and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic. There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources, and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material, and reinsert it into the article, I will present evidence which proves that 1) they have not read the material at all or 2) have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article, and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it. This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources. As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources, this is egregious original research, and given the nature of the information inserted, it can be seen as a blatant breach of WP:DIGWUREN. I would suggest that you not re-insert, as you will not want to get caught up in this. The next person to re-insert it will be reported to WP:AE.  Dialogue """,0

You do not need to show any point here. The dispute request and its resolution are open to anyone who wants to read it. It can be found here. You also do not need to insist here on your arguments that have already been refuted by participants in the dispute. The citations that you gave did not comply with the conditions of peer-review, sources were not reliable, and Echevarría's research has been qualified as a """"fringe theory"""" (see WP:FRINGE). That is the state of the question and it is now settled and closed. Thank you for editing the old """"New Works"""" section; however, your current editing is not complying with the terms of the resolution. The resolution presented by user Noleander said: """"For the Michael Servetus article, my suggestion would be that the """"New"""" section, which is rather large now, be compacted down to a one paragraph summary which summarizes Echeverría's claims, and makes it clear they are not endorsed by the majority."""" This suggestion was supported by all DRN volunteers who participated in the dispute. Your editing is still leaving excessive space to Echevarría's theory and it should be reduced to just one paragraph. However, footnotes have no particular limitation but they should not include claims that go against the resolution or pretend to ignore it. Your collaboration will be appreciated, of course, but if you fail to comply, I will apply the changes according to the terms of the resolution myself and take any other action that is necessary to preserve the quality and good standing of this article.

I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called """"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,"""" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax"""", or """"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation."""" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the """"""""Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident"""" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk """,0

Prameswara is indeed a common Sanskrit name. Prameswara is also incontrovertibly Indonesian, whether he was Sumatran or Javanese  is unclear- but he was definitely born in Sumatra int the court of Sriwijaya- not as the article states, in Temasek- which would make Prameswara a fisherman's child.
Islam arrived in Indonesia from Persia, Punjab and Gujarat- not China. Zheng He was a Hamafi muslim, not a Sufi. The earliest Muslim graves in Java proper date from 1368 (Banten) -1400 in Trowulan, the capital of Majapahit in the same complex as the cenetries of the highest nobility- which indicates the highest strata of Javanese society had already began to convert, predating the Eunuch Turkoman Hamafi Zheng He. Thus the ludicrous argument CHinese as part of the Wali Songo brought Islam to Java is disproved by archeological evidence.

You will also note- the Javanese repelled the Mongols- the only other Asians to successfully do so were the Japanese. Zheng He's navy was a navy for prestige and tribute- not a military navy. The Javanese under Singhasari later Majapahit also repelled the Siamese, and the Negerakertagama epoic already indicates there was Muslim activity or unrest in pre-Zheng He Java.

 Discussion moved from Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who 

I know you're all probably sick to your back teeth of hearing about it, but considering how we have just changed the name of the 1996 television film to Doctor Who (1996) (in my personal opinion, an infinitely better name), why not try to resolve the seemingly never ending debate of whether it is 100,000 BC or An Unearthly Child? Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)
 19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)

Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)  

I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...  

I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these """"newbies"""", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it """"An Unearthly Child"""").  20:39, 9 January 2006

The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   
 I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  

The CBC profile I think used """"Out of the Ashes"""", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  — (talk • contribs) 

The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  

That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006

I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  

It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is """"An Unearthly Child"""". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as """"An Unearthly Child"""" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.  (talk • contribs) 16:39, 11 January 2006",0

 Robert Sapolsky and shamanism 

Shouldn't Robert Sapolsky's theory about shamanism and schizotypalism as the source of schizophrenia be mentioned here? He is clearly a notable source on this subject. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI 173.17.92.242  
Before anyone else objects to Youtube as a source, I'll point out that this is Sapolsky giving a lecture. That said, this strikes me as a better fit for Causes of schizophrenia#Evolutionary psychology than here. It's a very speculative theory, albeit from a clearly notable commentator, with little experimental evidence, and it also focuses on what he calls schizotypical personality disorder, and not on schizophrenia per se.

Mr. Haider, the theory that Pashtuns are an East Iranian people is the most scientific theory about Pashtun origin based on linguistic and anthropological studies/evidences contrary to other theories which are just wild speculations and fantastic fairy tales. So please, now that Pashtun ethnography has taken proper course, don't push it back to speculative histography by making irrational proclaimations that """"Pashtuns are an old race of its own"""" and that """"Pashtuns are great"""". This is an encyclopedia article and it should relect the dominent academic view about Pashtun origin instead of folkloric myths. 

Further, in detail every ethnic group has a distinct culture but on general level, different ethnic groups align with each other to form super groups with the same cultural, linguistic, and ethnic roots. There really was a proto-Iranian language, ethnicity, and culture. Anthropology, linguistics, and even social structure align Pashtuns with other Iranian people. This is a fact that cannot be refuted with mere sermises and conjectures.

I further inform the editors that Pashtun population in Karachi was 1.1 millions according to 1998 census of Pakistan. That might have swelled to at most 1.3-1.4 millions by now. I request the editors to exclude the statement like """"Pashtuns are twice the number of Pashtuns in Afghanistan"""" because, first proper population census of Afghanistan are yet to be held and second this statement would unnecessarily propogate the impression that """"Pashtuns are now well integrated in one state or the other"""". Moreover, we already have have Pashtun populations in various countries mentioned in the side bar. 

Further, I couldn't understand this term """"Punjabi Pathan""""? Why coin such term in the first place?

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The introduction to the article makes the following claim: 

""""Beginning with the invasion in 2003, a Multinational coalition of forces, mainly American and British, has occupied Iraq. The invasion has led to increased civil violence, political breakdown, the removal and execution of former president Saddam Hussein, and national problems in the development of political balance, economy, infrastructure, and use of the country's massive reserves of oil.""""

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime. 

Given the freedoms the Iraqis now have, and have won for themselves, and their liberation from an undeniably tyrannical regime (facts not mentioned in this introduction), the claim that """"these issues have led to major setbacks for Iraq"""" is obviously opinion masquerading as fact.  """,0

Okay, I deleted the mention of him being an """"Arab"""" philosopher.

Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.

Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.

What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""". I don't particularly like """"backlash"""" in lead, but at least in should be framed in the more NPOV """"many scholars and other observers have described it as a backlash . . . """"   """,0

The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name.",0

The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.

I would suggest reading up on Hawking's idea (in his universe in a nutshell book) that mass energy + gravitational energy = 0. In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.",0

Time to start final editing
This article now has a wealth of information, more than enough to cover the subject. I suggest we begin to go through a section at a time and tighten up.
Is all sourced with recognized reliable sources? A scholarly article in a peer reviewed article may be a more appropriate source than a book review in a church magazine. (For instance, maybe the Lutheran Church parish magazine is not the best place to find scholarly information on Martin Luther? I'm Lutheran, so I can poke at myself for fun.)
Is the grammar OK?
How is POV?
Is it covered in other articles and can be removed or moved to the appropriate article?
Evaluate the number and usefulness of some of the citations.
I share some (not all) of Blue Tie's frustrations about the article. Perhaps some fresh editors can read through it for continuity and point out where the article is unclear and where it is too detailed or muddled.
Are our sources balanced? Have we used too many or too few apologetic works?
Have we strayed into Original Research by using so much from the Journal of Discourses? Do any of the established reliable sources cover this same material? Can we quote from them instead? I don't know, but think it should be discussed.

Blue Tie's comments about the background section intro have made me evaluate some of what I wrote. I still need to tighten up and give attributions. I might say """"Historians Brooks and Quinn, as well as others, attribute the Mountain Meadows massacre to a number of factors relating to the conditions in the Utah Territory in 1857."""" Both are mentioned in the ref sections for curious readers to check out. The succeeding subsections should point to the exact citations in those sources.

We need to be evaluating and clarifying, not expanding. (Yes, this is my opinion and it is never humble.) The article is not coming together, it is becoming unwieldy. I came in to help with citations, so I have little ownership for the earlier content. Perhaps my edits have only added to the confusion. I am trying to remain neutral, but it is easy to get sucked in. Are there tools to use for editing? I have been using a sandbox to do major re-writes, then moving it over. Do we want to take a section at a time somewhere else and cuss and discuss it? I have never worked to create a featured article, so I look for guidance in the best way to proceed.

There are basically three of us now editing, and it may be time to step back and let others with a fresh eye work for a while. I know I have miles of articles to go before I sleep. So, I am looking for direction. (and going to work.)  """,0

Which is not even consistently used by the states that adopted it at national level? Those states are in a minority anyway, a fact you have made every effort to exclude from the page.

 Proposed Intervening Section on """"Controversial New York Times Story"""" 

Rather than argue over the title or contents of the disputed second section regarding the pertinence of the controversial petition itself, I propose to insert an intervening section about the controversy stirred up by the appearance of Kenneth Chang's 2006 story in the NY Times, wherein Picard's name is mentioned.  The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.

Here is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.

Controversial New York Times Story

In February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.""""Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 """"100 Scientists"""" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,"""" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, """"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."""" 

Chang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously """"dissenters from Darwinism"""" or """"anti-evolution.""""  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as """"anti-evolution"""" """"dissenters"""" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as """"dissent.""""  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.

The last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, """"A plague on both their houses.""""  

Skip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, saying

The signatories appear to attest to a statement about the ability of natural selection to """"account for the complexity of life"""" - in other words, a statement about how evolution t",0

1. Neutrality according to WP is presenting facts in such a fashion that both sides accept. """"Occupied"""" isn't accepted by one side, """"Moroccan"""" isn't accepted by the other side.

9. What you are saying is your interpretation of the HR reports, I respect your opinion. My opinion is completely different, I say that HR was repressed in the whole Morocco.

 Wahabi and terrorism 

I have added this heading with neutral and verifiable sources which is most missing point from this Article.

Wahabi relationship with Terrorism
Wahabism,Saudi Arabia’s dominant faith is an austere form of Sunni Islam and Its explosive growth began in the 1970s when Saudi charities started funding Wahabi schools and mosques.[22] Professor Bernard Lewis, a leading scholar of Islam, has noted that the Wahhabis are to Islam what the Ku Klux Klan is to Christianity. They can be accused of hijacking Islam.[23]
The Wahabi movement is directly involved in terrorist activities all over the World.The Al Qaeda and a lot of recent Islamic terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, have been inspired by Wahabism[24]. The regular Bombing of shrines in Pakistan and Killing of Sunnis and Shias is done by Sipah-e-Sahaba and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan).[25] Wahabism is associated with the removal of head stones from the graves of the members of the family of the Prophet Muhammed, and the desecration of Islamic shrines in Hejaz and Karbala in Iraq, and the struggle for power in what was yet to become Saudi Arabia. Once its followers took power, they did whatever they could to destroy Ethiopia. For example, the secessionist war in Eritrea (1958-1991), which was designed to make Ethiopia land-locked, was largely financed by Saudi Arabia. Likewise, Saudi finance made it possible for Somalia to invade Ethiopia in 1977- 1978. The Saudi authorities may deny this, but it is widely documented. [26]
[edit]In Pakistan

The JamatudDawah ,Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,Lashkar-e-Taiba and Sipah Sahaba are main terrorist organization of Wahabi movements .These terrorist organizations have been banned by Pakistani government but are working by their new names. Arab states especially Saudi Arabia and GCC states have been funding extremist Deobandi and Wahabis in Pakistan, since the Afghan Jihad.Pakistan has became a battleground between Saudi Arabia funded Deobandi and Wahabis and Iran funded Shia causing deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims.[27],
[edit]In India

Wahhabism, an austere, puritanical interpretation of Islam promoted by Saudi Arabia, is making deep inroads into Kashmir due to the efforts of the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, which calls itself a religious and welfare organisation.Kashmir's non-Muslim minority, too, views the Wahhabi ingress as a """"conspiracy to Talibanise Kashmir"""". """"The Taliban had also sprung from Pakistani madrassas funded by the Wahhabis,"""" says former Kashmir University professor Kashi Nath Pandita. [28]

Sumple’s views are subject to the Racial Vilification Act 1996 (NSW), and I would hate to see articles in Wikipedia brought into disrepute on that basis.

You changed """"metabolized"""" to """"metabolised"""" on 19 March 2005.
Then on 6 April, you added """"synthesised"""", after you had changed to metabolised a couple of weeks earlier.
And this week you changed """"labeled"""" to """"labelled"""". 
It was only the last one that was done specifically to make that change.  The others are the type of thing I might inadvertently do myself, in the opposite direction.  Especially when I'm only editing one section, I'm usually not going to go back and check to see what the rest of the article uses (which might not be consistent in any case).
But it was the last one, with your editorial comment just saying """"spelling"""" as if the spelling were incorrect, which made me look into it in the first place.  That's why I made sure that I pointed out that I wasn't changing the spelling just because of my own spelling preferences.   """,0

Here is the problem that I have with this. They built a structure before Benjamin Franklin. Nowhere in my own indepdnent research is there any substantiative proof that contends that when this tower was built in Russia, it was specificially intended to strike lightning. They might have built a lightning rod. However, that very well was not their intention, thus not realizing what they accomplished.

In order to claim an """"invention"""", one has to conceive of the initial and original idea. And that is exactly what Benjamin Franklin did in 1749 with his kite experiments and work in electricity. 

Also, I stand by my point that the citation/reference being used is quite unacceptable. This is English Wikipedia and not Russian Wikipedia. A reader of this pae should not have to have the text translated thereby setting themselves up for misinterpretation of what is being claimed. Until this Russian claim can be defended, which it is not, it is dubious due to the points I have made up above.  """,0

From the stories I heard from my father, it sounded like John C Shumate separated from the military, opened a pharmacy and at some point went back into the military. My father mentioned a story about John C Shumate being in the Military MP's and in one incident taking a group of MP's to remove a bunch of squatters that had moved onto an old deserted military base. Have you heard of Richard Marcinko? He is the founder of Seal Team Six (Counter Terrorist) and Red Cell. Red Cell was a group of Navey Seals tasked with going to different Naval Bases to test security. They basically acted like terrorist, they tried to sneek onto Naval Bases, kidnap high ranking officials, plant explosive etc etc. The reason I mention this is because according to my Dad John C Shumate did this at some in the military. He apparently tested the security of an Air Base because as the story goes, he planted a fake explosive in a culvert(small tunnel) under a runway.

aeba791e4d78ac12,""":I'm not sure what all the issues have been with your edits and the rest of the community. As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]"""" 
I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

Then the stuff about m_ij and so on could be presented as consequences of the definition.  And those who know about presentations could then say """"Ah, yes, and in fact the class of Coxeter groups can be defined via presentations"""".

I think in general definitions should involve just as little apparatus as possible, and only involve extra machinery when that significantly shortens and simplifies what is being defined.

An easier definition should never depend on a harder definition.

Of course, if i'm wrong and this is not what a Coxeter group is, somebody please explain and give a counterexample, and thanks in advance.

Hipocrite, I doubt that one isolated incident is evidence of a long history of a pattern of incivility.  If there are other examples in recent history, I'd be happy to evaluate them.  But no, it doesn't mean that if Pedro slips up 9 months from now, he's going to be insta-blocked for all eternity.  And, as for being on the recall list: Pedro asked me a long time ago if I'd have any objections to being on the list, and I said no.  That's about it.  As far as I am aware, being on the list means that I have the option of petitioning Pedro to relinquish his admin privileges, nothing more.  It doesn't mean I'm obligated to stalk all of his edits and make sure he's behaving.  At this point, I haven't seen any evidence that would convince me that he is no longer fit to be an admin.  Were the comments uncivil?  Of course they were.  Do they deserve a desysop or a block?  In my opinion, unless there is clear evidence that this was more than just an isolated incident of a personal attack, then no.  Everyone screws up from time to time.  We don't desysop/block people because they had a bad day, unless it can be shown that they've been having a bunch of bad days recently, and that it is disrupting people's ability to contribute to the encyclopedia.  Frankly (and I know you will probably all see this as the cabal protecting itself), I see this as a witch hunt against an admin that you don't particularly get along with.  If you have a real issue with Pedro and you have real evidence that this is a long-term problem, then please present evidence in the form of diffs and I will gladly evaluate it.  But, I'm not going to waste my time searching for it myself, because my hunch is that this is not going anywhere.  | spout _ """,0

Most of your edits are fine. Thank you for restoring previous edits in a non-POV way which I think is acceptable. Most of the article is fine. I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?

Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, """"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).""""""",0

Just a few thoughts.

I dare say the article overall is rather biased, though I'd point out 1 instance where it understates its case: the burning of churches in Spain started before the Civil War, & was 1 of its causes.
AC does seem to be largely anti-Catholic. It's been said (somewhere) that you tend to get AC in Catholic countries, secularism in Protestant ones.

 How Do Tornadoes Form? 

 Tornadoes form when the land is slightly damp and there is high winds. When there is a bad storm in the mountains you will often hear about Tornado Warnings. Not every storm turns into a tornado/twister.
 People know the Tornado as a Twister. You will hear people all around you say """"Twister."""" Do not be alarmed if you come across a tornado one day, just find a ditch and lay in it for awhile.

Point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:

Sustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.

Sustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).

    Oh, now you're comparing the legendary Phil Hellmuth to a pint of rocky rhode ice cream?      What has this discussion degraded into.  Different people have different tastes, but Hellmuth's television appeal can be statistically proven.  Perhaps """"popular television"""" would be more accurate, but the phrase """"great television"""" is understood to mean just that.  """"Ice cream tastes great"""" is not analagous because the verb 'tastes' serves as a link between the noun 'ice cream' and the adjective 'great' implying that ice cream is objectively great.  This would be a foolish leap and it would violate Wikipedia's NPOV policy.  Please keep this dialogue on topic and refrain from such faulty analogs.  The subject matter of this discussion is Phil Hellmuth, not ice cream or your aversion to personal attack.
    Let's let others chime in on this topic and come to a clear consensus.

2d0e12040d23b5f1,"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

(BTW - click on the """"tag"""" page of your """"source"""".)  

Honestly, I read it. But I don't give a damn what you wrote. Apparently you are one of those """"I must be right, or heaven shall fall"""" type of people. But, yet again. So you're making your own rules for Wikipedia now? You know, the public place? ....Cute.

But, as always there is that one prick in the crowd. You know what though, KoRn sings about sad matters, about how they are lonely and scared little boys and no one gets them. Maybe they should be on that list of """"exmaples"""", I've heard them be called emo before. (This is a retort, personally I like KoRn) With that.

 How to insert new data into a sortable table 

Sorting makes the lists more useful, but more marginally more difficult to add new data.  It's not difficult once you understand that sorting numerically isn't possible because of BC in some of the years and commas in the casualty figures.  All we are doing here is converting those numbers into an alphabetic format that the table can sort.

Sorting for casualties, zero padding is necessary if we are going to use comma separators
CCCC represents the casualty number
Use:{{formatnum:{{padleft:CCCC|7|0}}}} 
Example: {{formatnum:{{padleft:300000|7|0}}}} produces 0,300,000
In case of a range, like (5,000-10,000), only the first number needs to use the formatnum template to make it sortable.
The use of the tilde '~' destroys the sort order.  I don't think it's really necessary since almost all of these numbers are approximate anyway.

To make years sortable we have to insert invisible characters before the actual values.
To do this, we use  anything here is invisible
 YYYY represents the year
For years BC:
Use: !{{#expr: 9999 - YYYY}} YYYY BC
Example: 846 BC becomes !{{#expr: 9999 - 846}} 846 BC
Note the space just before the . It is necessary!
For years AD:
We pad left N number of zeros to make the year 4 digits
Use: #NYYYY
Example: 3 becomes #0003
Example: 34 becomes #0034
Example: 345 becomes #0345
Example: 1456 becomes #1456
Note there is no space before and after the . Also necessary!

It looks more complex than it really is, trust me ;)""",0

Speedy deletion of Sarah Zietlow
 A tag has been placed on Sarah Zietlow requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Come down please from your high horse Ms. SlimVirgin and answer my charge against you. If you liked AE so much that you were nominating him for administrator why you imposed yourself as the mediator? Why you were so unfair to me from the start and broke ALL the rules of Wikipedia. Now you accuse me of the same. I repeatedly asked you to be specific. You failed because you can’t. But I can. I can show you broke the rules of Wikipedia on many instances. Instead of lecturing me, you must apologize for being biased. 

“sweeping generalizations about certain religions?” So you don’t like any criticism about your religion do you? What part of my criticism of Islam was sweeping generalization? I have been very specific so far and tried to provide opposing views to Islam. You simply do not have the tolerance for that. That is why you decry my contributions and call them “sweeping generalization” or try to dismiss them as  Islamophobia. Are views contrary to Christianity Chistianophobia? Do we have anyone crying Judaismphobia, Hinduphobia or Buddhistphobia? Why only Muslims make that claim? It is to silence any voice of opposition. You did that here and you even sided each time with my opponent to ban my views. This is unethical. Is that an insult? Am I allowed to say you acted unethically? Or would I be banned again? If this is not despotism what it is? Of course you can’t jail or kill me. But you do what you can. You censor me, violate my rights and ban me. 

Go ahead. Block me. That is all you can do. You are unable to respond to any of my accusations against you. So using force is all you can do.  09:02 27 Oct. 2005",0

903e88e658e66b8d,"""KERNAL is the original name as I spec'd it.  I'll let someone else edit how Bob Metcalf (ethernet PARC and 3Com founder) was a consultant at the Moorpark R&D; facility for Commodore in the summer of 1980.

The """"N"""" was for networking. I provided hooks in the PET ROM so that the """"Teacher's PET"""" be attached to a master-slave network. In the Commodore 64 there was a cartridge with the networking software and an interface card to the 6522 serial port.  We had two test installations in New Brighton Middle School in Capitola, Ca. and the Watsonville Middle School in Watsonville, Ca. Both had a PET with 30 C-64's. I developed all the hardware and did the fabrication myself.  Later a school in Wayne, PA was set up with a similar installation.

Another misconception is the origin of the Vic-20.  The real creator of the concept was Jim Kennedy who was the Commodore engineering manager after Chuck Peddle left in August, 1978 to work at Apple. Jack Tramiel asked him to visit MOS and he talked to Bob Yannes where he got the specs for the VIC chip.  He and I discussed a prototype VIC-20  but unfortunately Kennedy was canned in February 1980 when CHuck was re-hired by Commodore.

White light is a wavefront with power(energy) equally distributed across the visible frequency spectrum. When the wavefront has power levels distributed at different frequencies so that some parts the spectrum have more or less power, then we call that a color. The wavefront that impacts the eye to produce the sensation of Magenta has high power levels in the lower and higher frequencies and low power levels in the center frequencies. It is just one wavefront but shaped in power intensity vs frequency. There is no such thing as different colors of light waves, only a wavefront that has a power vs frequency shape. As such there are not incoming different frequencies of light to produce a color, its just one wavefront. No separate blue or red light enters the eye to be combined and produce a color. The color is inherent in the energy distribution of the wavefront which stimulates the frequency sensitive biological receptors in proportion to the power levels within the wavefront.

It is for this reason that Magenta is (as are all colors) spectral. It is the energy vs frequency distribution of the incoming wavefront that produces the perceived color sensation. Any color you like can be produced by a single tunable light source through modulation.

One wavefront .... not seperate incoming light colors.",0

Calling facts personal attacks.

But I tried to reason with this person who uses wilki to promote and excuse dog fighting as a test.. I asked for references in English and none can be provided.

I provided a New York Times reference and that is removed because it proves it is a blood sport running amock in Russia excused as a test.

I do not make a living off a breeding dogs . But I wish to protect the breed from breed specific legislation. This wrong missleading information posted here does REAL life harm to the breed.

The Russian have created as per more ref a new fighting breed.

Please if you insist on working with this editor while I spend time rescueing all the dogs she forgets in shelters. I cant do all the rescues and stay here fulltime, and care for my farm and dogs. 

So pls i beg youn change the name from CAS to CAO and have her ruin the breed under its russian version name . Allow me to try to save the breed from future bsl.

Maybe if a non competive type person posts , maybe then this would be settled.
So I will contact the writer of link that is being hidden from all , cause it proves the information about the 'test"""" is false.

Hi - I’m User:CCFSDCA (Christopher Corbett-Fiacco) and I understand the concerns expressed by many of you regarding the articles I’ve posted at Wikipedia the past week or so. I am in fact the author of The Whole World Calendar Book of Holidays Around the World, as stated (an as-yet unpublished book which is based upon the self-published The Whole World Calendar 2008 [and 2009; email me at wholeworldcalendar@gmail.com and I’ll be glad to send you a sample page and info on ordering, if interested]). I have sent Wikipedia its permissions grant for using copyrighted material as requested and assure you that I am not self-promoting. My mistake is in not yet spending the time to figure out exactly how to cite the book as the reference for the article, which I’ll do as soon as I have the time. My intent in adding the articles is that they are actual national/religious/cultural holidays and festivals, are therefore ‘newsworthy’ if not particularly important, and, having spent two years researching the topic, I can assure you that it is quite difficult at times to find such information  try to find out what Earthquake Victims Memorial Day is in Armenia and you’ll see what I mean. It is my intent to self-publish the book within 6 months if I cannot find a publisher. Meanwhile, feel free to delete my articles as desired. I’ll revisit the subject at a later date and repost them only after I’ve ascertained that I am, in fact, doing it right. Meanwhile, I’m not copying from somebody else  those articles are my own  that’s the way I write. Thanks much.   Chris Corbett-Fiacco",0

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites.",0

To Derild4921 and Sadads: If your main dispute is the sourcing with the original article then why did you not contact me, as I could have provided the additional source material - you can see from my contributions I just author Tunnels books on here. As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't """"about to killed"""" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this. The authors have often been kind enough to verify and supply content for my article. Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response. Thanks (  )""",0

 Advice on editing 

I see that you have had what must be an unencouraging start to editing Wikipedia, with several articles you have created being deleted, and others replaced by redirects to existing articles. My advice to new editors is that it is best to start by making small improvements to existing articles, rather than creating new articles. That way any mistakes you make (which you will, because we all do) will be small ones, and you won't have the discouraging experience of repeatedly seeing hours of work deleted. Gradually, you will get to learn how Wikipedia works, and after a while you will know enough about what is acceptable to be able to write whole new articles without fear that they will be deleted. Over the years I have found that editors who start by making small changes to existing articles and work up from there have a far better chance of having a successful time here than those who jump right into creating new articles from the start.

The advantage of this was that during the recording of observational documentaries in places like institutions (e.g. A school or Hospital) the film maker could provide a point in which to synchronize the image on the film with the sound recording taken without disturbing the subject or subjects during the time of filming.

I do not see how it is relevant if sources use the word famous.  We are never obliged to use the same words as any source.

I'm not sure if you are Spyros Sofos or just a fan of his but Wikipedia is not a blog to promote the personal political views of Mr. Sofos and/or his associates.  I say this because your posting history here seems to reflect a cheerleading mentality towards Mr. Sofos rather than accepting that everyone can also be criticized for their views.

A couple of myths you believe that I'd like to clear up.

a. Spyros Sofos makes it clear that he does not see himself related to ancient Greeks in his works. Despite confusion over using similar nomenclature this effectively means his use of the word """"Greek"""" is of non-ethnic Greek context. Mr. Sofos see's national/ethnic identities as """"imagined communities"""".  (and not only Greeks  he deconstructs Turkish identity as well). While he is allowed to have a philosophical point of view, he can't have his proverbial cake and eat it too. He's a Greek citizen but not an ethnic Greek.

b. Spyros Sofos is certainly criticized by the far right in Greece but this point obfuscates its not just the far right that criticizes him. For instance, Mr. Sofos uses the word """"Macedonia"""" to describe the former Yugoslav republic is criticized by Greeks of all political persuasions (including both moderate left and right parties). His  narration of history is also criticized by Greeks of all political affiliations for casually dismissing Greek themes present since antiquity.

User:GFHandel is clearly correct here. DuLithgow’s coming in and deciding that this CAD editor is that is not notable, as  was clearly way off base.

Moreover, Duncan’s , over the last few days to delete all manner of CAD programs from this list is clearly without consensus and needs a clear consensus when the edits aren’t copyediting but are instead massive use of the [delete] key. Editors are all here on en.Wikipedia to build the project. The way things are done here are the product of years of consensus building and an evolution of processes. Moreover, the editors active on the CAD-related articles tend to have extensive experience with the subject matter. It is clear that the evolved intention of the list of CAD editors is to make it an inclusive and comprehensive list that readers can use as an authoritative source for what programs have been developed over the years. Before deleting scores of man-hours of material that other editors have slaved over, there must be a clear consensus here on this talk page for the material’s removal.

Since there is clearly no consensus for these latest edits throughout the project and here on this list,  to the previous consensus view. Please bear in mind that consensus can change.

Ocaasi,
Have you had a chance to read the Journal of Rheumatology article I tried to add as a reference on the chiropractic page?  I don't know who quackguru is but I have a feeling from the name that there is at least a hint of bias.  The article by Ernst is the only article (with multiple flaws) that I know that has ever even stated that the risk by far outweighs the benefits.  Most of the articles I have seen state that manipulation (which is only one part of chiropractic) is at least as effective and most conclude that manipulation used with a multimodal approach such as with exercise therapy has a synergistic effect and is by far safer than OTC meds, NSAID's and prescription medications in the long term.  Think about it, less than 30 deaths after billions of treatments over 100 years is surely considered extremely safe.  I contacted the American Chriopractic Association.  They stated that they have already tried to provide information about scope of practice to Wikipedia but they are having troubles with posting to the page also.  If there is ever a source that should be considered respectable to Wikipedia, it should be the American Chiropractic Association (the chiropractic equivalent to the American Medical Association).  Please let me know what I need to do to get the more positive and consistent research to post to this page.  I am a little suprised at how difficult this is.  I have peer reviewed medical research and the American Chiropractic Association trying to provide proof that the information I presented was accurate.  I am not sure what else I can do.

The Constitution also authorized Congress to borrow money, and Congress done that by authorizing the issuance of bills of credit known as United States currency notes. Those notes represent debts payable in United States dollars. Similarly, Federal Reserve Notes are issued by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and those notes are, by statute, redeemable in United States dollars. 

Each Federal Reserve Note identifies the issuing bank by the first character in the note's serial number. For example, the letter """"A"""" represents the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. A complete list (A through L) can be found in Federal Reserve Bank. The Organization Cetificate of each Federal Reserve Bank is on file in the office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Each certificate lists the names of the private banks that own and control the Federal Reserve Bank named in the certificate.

United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes are not United States dollars.  Those notes are evidences of indebtedness, not """"money"""" as the word money is used in the U.S. Constitution. Please understand the distinction between money and notes payable in money.   """,0

I think  is making a distinction between IS and OUGHT. Activities within a process SHOULD add value, but sometimes they don't. Within BPR, people often make a distinction between """"As-Is"""" processes and """"To-Be"""" processes. Perhaps it would be useful to make this explicit within the article. 

However, complex processes may include activities whose value-add is obscure or difficult to quantify. For example, a salesman carries out some social chat prior to demonstrating the product, and this possibly converts the customer to a more receptive state. A craftsman may play around with the materials before starting construction, which may possible put him into a more creative/innovative state. But do we really want to engineer every business conversation or playful bricolage to optimize some desired state-transition? This is BPR not NLP.

First of all, though it is true that I learned that NYB is an attorney from Wikipediocracy, there are no entries in relation to you on that website, as a simple search via their search engine would have indicated had you taken the time to check, as a courtesy .
The fact of the matter is, I learned about your status as an undergraduate studying law from your own User page Hi, I'm Anthony, an undergraduate and Wikipedia contributor from Scotland. where you make it a point to make it prominent that you are:
an undergraduate

from Scotland
Well, good for you. Maybe someday you'll even become an attorney, after you graduate from college, and maybe pass a bar exam, that is. 
Now, the edit summary of that diff of your eliminating that information from your User page is sort of interesting(off-wiki stuff probably isn't interesting to most people)
And what is even more interesting, is that it occurred on August 24, just after you'd posted fallacious FoF about me and voted to indefinitely topic-ban me from the Tea Party movement article. 
Why is it, do you suppose, that I, for one, would not be interested in such information about you?
Clearly there is a question as to your WP:Competence, as far as I'm concerned, but I will defer to Jimbo Wales on that point for our purposes here, as you are undoubtedly aware that there is an appeal of the decision you are heavily implicated in on his Talk page. 
At any rate, I have to get some sleep now, so I will simply ask reviewing admins to visit Jimbo's Talk page and follow the links. I've linked to you Talk page there as well. 
As far as I'm concerned, and I have stated this on the Tea Party movement PD Talk page, WP:SPADE is the operative policy here.
I've merely repeated information you'd posted long ago on your User page and recently deletedfor whatever private reasons.
Clearly I disagree with your FoF and decisions, and question your WP:COMPETENCE to serve on ARBCOM in light of the unjust actions you have take against me.

I agree with George Profulis, a respected local meterologist. New Jersey is hit by a Category 1 or 2 storm directly (landfall) about once every 100 years (last in 1903, putting us 6 years overdue), and by a Category 3 or 4 landfalling storm every 200 years (last 1821, 188 years ago, coming due soon). Major storms passing within 50 miles off our coast ('38, '44, Donna, Belle, Gloria) causing a """"direct hit"""" are far more common, and can be just as damaging and deadly. I would say that a repeat of '44 today, would cause Katrina-like damage in the Northeast. New Jersey might be small, but it is also the most densely populated state in the nation. Many of the homes, especially those along the shore, are only a few feet apart.  A good storm surge like seen in '44 would devastate 100 miles of prime real estate that is far more valuable per square mile then that along the Gulf Coast. Also, strong storms passing to our west (Gale of 1878, Tropical Storm David in 1979) can put N.J. in a storm's right front quadrant, the most vicious part of the cyclone""",0

Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another, I wouldn't have closed it.  But it is clear that no consensus exists and that the proper venue is the RfC where wider input can be obtained.-'''' Poppa Balloon'' """,0

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

 Background 

The background people keep reverting to, in spite of all discussion, is still absolute Israeli bias.
 
Firstly the version you keep reverting to does not mention the fundamental background to the Israeli-Lebanese conflicts, the existence of Palestinian refugees. Secondly the """"failed to control"""" phrase in the first sentence has connotations far too negative towards Lebanon, and ignores the fact that Lebanon has suffered far more greatly than Israel from militancy within its borders. Thirdly the background mentions that Hizbollah continued to make attacks on Israel after Israeli withdrawal from most of Lebanon (attacks whose frequency have incidentally been greatly exaggerated), yet it doesn't mention that Israel also carried out incursions into Lebanon during this period. Once again I re-iterate, it is those who keep reverting who are not respecting the neutrality of this article, and no-one has has yet explained to me how I in any way am breaching WP:NPOV in this article

By the way, Yandman, are you American? I only ask because a lot of Americans are ignorant of the Arab position in middle-east conflict and instictively pro-Israeli,even when Israel commits the most horrific war crimes, they therefore often misconstrue otherwise lucid neutrality for pro-Muslim bias.

 Claims of Non-Neutrality from the Non-Neutral, a.k.a., Double-Standards for Darwin 

Hello,

I'm writing to report a case of non-neutrality from the user . After editing the page on Irreducible complexity to make it more neutral, my changes were reverted, and I received the following message from the aforementioned user:

Welcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view. A contribution you made to Irreducible complexity appears to carry a non-neutral point of view, and your edit may have been changed or reverted to correct the problem. Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon 

I'm fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I'm confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.

Notice the non-neutrality in Saedon's message:

ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.

This is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon's part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called """"scientific community."""" They take it seriously because it's a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon's non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.

I refute that claim.

I'm atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It's no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.

I expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.

Thank you.

- from User_talk:Tobias Conradi -

Hello Tobias,
Thought you'd like to know I've recently concluded a useful email correspondence with a member of staff at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In short, it appears the NGA uses a four to five level system not unlike NUTS+LAU; I've transcribed it from the table sent by email into the wikitable below:

 Feature Designation Code  Name                                  Text ADM1  first-order administrative division   a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States ADM2  second-order administrative division  a subdivision of a first-order administrative division ADM3  third-order administrative division   a subdivision of a second-order administrative division ADM4  fourth-order administrative division  a subdivision of a third-order administrative division ADMD  administrative division               an administrative division of a country, undifferentiated as to administrative level

The NGA leaves the definitions (""""Text"""" in the above table) of ADMs 2-4 """"intentionally vague... All we attempt to identify with the ADM is the hierarchical structure, and if there is no hierarchy, then the level of importance or size (with ADM1 being the largest).""""

In a table of global country subdivisions, would you expect all those entities found in a particular column (i.e. at a particular level) to be similar in """"importance or size"""" – presumably where """"size"""" might mean area or population...?

4edb5bc7f1a357e6,"I've also looked at Shervink's sources and I find them all to be either biased, inaplicable, or unreliable. In my opinion Shervink is advocating a minority viewpoint. Perhaps he should express within the article and note it as such, but clearly it is not reasonable to expect this view to be represented equally with generally accepted facts. 
I feel that this is mostly a well written and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointless. These events are accepted by most sources to have been a coup. What this means is that Mossadeq is accepted to have been the leader of Iran at the time in question, and to have been deposed. The phrase counter-coup implies that Mossadeq deposed the Shah first, which according to the ample scholarship cited in this article, is not what happened. 
It is of course possible that the concensus of scholarship on this issue is in error, but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition, holders of minority viewpoints. 
That said, I do think Shervink's views are interesting and should be included (and noted as a minority viewpoint) in the article. This issue is generally seen as the west vs. Iran with the shah on the side of the west. A point of view more sympathetic to the monarchy is rarely heard.  Itsafarce",0

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge.""",0

There's also no issue in his insistence that he's right and everybody around him is wrong, even in the face of proof. And it's perfectly ok for fellow """"volunteers"""" to not read issues properly and back each other up no matter their faults and pretend like there's no problems in their actions. Enjoy having wikipedia edited by Verdy and his ignorant bunch, who prioritize preaching account creation to IP users such as myself instead of worrying about article content validity, for which they're part of the problem.70.51.38.110  """,0

 My block/unblock 

On the current arb case, there is a proposed decision dealing with myself at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#Russavia. It appears that several arbs have asked for another proposal to be put forward, which I have done at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Workshop#Editing_restrictions_proposal; I don't know if they are aware of this proposal or not. I have another issue, that being my indef block which was put on myself for a perceived legal threat. This has been mentioned at Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#On_Russavia, and it has also been mentioned there and on the proposed decision case page, that WP:NLT should be dealt with as per that policy. I have dealt with on the PD talk page, and also on my talk page at User_talk:Russavia#Alleged_legal_threats_issued_by_myself_and_unblock_request, as per WP:NLT. It should be mentioned that my indef block was not as a result of any arbcom enforcement, nor as a result of a community supported ban, but as a result of the perceived legal threat. The indef ban was lifted so that I could participate in the Arbcom proceedings, but at that stage WP:NLT had not been dealt with to the satisfication of the blocking admin.? Anyway, I would like to seek some clarification from you at the clerk for this case, as to what I would need to do in order to have the indef block """"officially"""" lifted, so to speak, so that I can return to editing within the confines of the topic ban handed down by Sandstein. Your advice is appreciated.  Dialogue 
Given the Committee didn't pass that temporary injunction, I'd suggest that you are still under the restrictions set down as part of the unblock-to-participate-in-the-RfAr. When the case closes, I expect the Committee will deal with your blocking/unblocking in some way in the final decision; depending on what the final decision is in this regard (there are an infinite number of possibilities), you/we can re-evaluate the best course of action at that point. 
The only way to have the conditions on the unblock lifted before the final decision would be to appeal to the Community and get consensus to overturn the block; I doubt that this would be successful given the parallel arbitration proceedings, as most Wikipedians will likely say """"just see what ArbCom decides then play it from there"""".
My $0.02. Regards,   
Thanks for your reply Daniel, its appreciated. As you can understand I am in a state of purgatory at the moment, not really knowing what may come, and whether the committee will indeed address this, as several arbs have already stated their opinion that cases of WP:NLT should be addressed by the community. Given that WP:DIGWUREN took some 3 months to reach a conclusion, and other cases can take longer, I would hate for this case to take that long only for committee to turn my indef block back to the community. As I am a content creation driven editor, you can probably understand that this is less like purgatory, and more like hell. Do you think it may be possible to seek clarification from the Committee if the issue of my indef block for WP:NLT will be dealt with by them, or not? If not, I would expect this would free me up to take the issue to the community via an avenue such as WP:AN in order to allow me to continue editing, under the confines of the topic ban imposed by another admin, with that perhaps being addressed by Arbcom (the topic ban). Sorry for being a pain in the arse, but hopefully you understand my predicament and hence why I think it would need clarification from the Committee, as to whether it will or won't be addressed. As you are the clerk, might you be so kind as to seek clarification for me, if you don't mind of course. Also, my apologies for bringing this to your talk page, as I am totally new to Arbcom proceedings (hoping this will be my one and only involvement in one), I am somewhat bamboozled at to where to ask for clarification on the case pages; it is a dog's breakfast that is for sure.  Dialogue 
Not at all, no need to apologise. I will certainly pursue a line of inquisition with the Committee about what they recommend you do and what their intended course of action is on the issue; if you haven't heard back from me by Monday please ping me again (the weekend is normally rather busy for me, so if it's not sorted and I haven't got an answer from the relevant Committee members by then, I'll probably be unable to progress the issue though Friday night/Saturday/Sunday",0

Placenames in Kosovo

Please, before making or discussing changes to the names used in all Kosovo-related topics, review carefully our general naming conventions and the specific ones on geographic names, using English & settlements.

In short, they ask us to reflect common English usage (which will often will be a local name, or one of them; but not always), because those are the forms our intended readership of English speakers would most easily recognize.

For a number of historical reasons, the English language has adopted the Serbian forms. We merely restrict ourselves to reflect this usage. Wikipedia is not a venue to advocate the adoption of the Albanian names by the English language.

The names will be modified only if the English usage itself changes to something else, or if our current naming conventions themselves are amended to """"reflect local usage instead of English one"""". - Best regards,   """,0

a6855d3e749c2cde,"""::(1) The french engines (40 HP) were superior, to those the Wright brothers claimed they built (less than 20 HP), being more powerful. (2) The brothers used the same catapult, the same extra boost, as in 1905 in all their witnessed flights performed in 1908. In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Correct, they didn't """"need"""" more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are """"their own fiction"""" is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   
 I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements. The so called reputed historians are just pro Wright Brothers propagandists who simply selected what they liked from primary sources and made up a nice story for the public, disregarding all evidence that throws serious doubts regarding the claimed 1903-1905 flights.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Interestingly, the primary sources of which you're fond include voluminous amounts of documentation by the WB themselves of their work and their success. Try some affirmation based on that. You're right, though: propaganda does existnot in the writings of respected historians, but in misguided scribblings that sometimes show up on these pages.   

There is mention of the seven """"French"""" engines of 1908 here:  http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f260.image.r=wright.langEN. They are intended to be delivered as  """"seven perfect copies"""" of the model brought by the american aviator.   

 Strange picture - On Dec. 14, 1903, W. Wright flew with the two propellers on the left side of the plane, one of them not connected to the engine! 

The picture labeled LC-W86- 20, (see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/item/2001696254/ ) from the Library of Congress, shows W. Wright just after he landed the plane on Dec. 14, 1903, damaging the front-rudder (the canard double wing). The flight was powered but the airplane landed below the altitude where it had taken off. The strange thing about this picture is that the plane (see one of the large size versions of the image) has both propellers on its left side, the leftmost propeller being not connected to the engine. There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity. 

""""There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity."""" Indeed, a perfect description of the posts above and below. I recommend an optometrist.   
Ok. It was my mistake. I was mislead by the optical illusion the image contains. I should have studied the photography more carefully.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138

 A tag has been placed on Marzipan Moss requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    [[User talk:Flyguy649|talk]] """,0

 Concerns
Got a message about an hour ago from Professor Obar of the Media and Telecommunication Policy project and I think it is viewed best in full:

Can you please communicate to the online mentors that I DO NOT want them moving student material into the main space for them. This is a big problem. I have noticed that this has happened with a number of the projects already, for example, in the broadband.gov article and the media cross-ownership article. We need the students to be doing this on their own, of course so they can learn how to do it, and also so that I can grade what they've done. How am I supposed to follow student submissions if the data is associated with online mentors? A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY... please help me with this. None of you responded to my post about this on the discussion page. This is about to get out of hand. Jaobar (talk) 

With that, of course, please only give instructions on how to move, don't do it for them.  Please only let them know what to do and let them do it themselves.  If they run into problems, provide further instructions.  Do not it for them.  This seems to be making a mess of Prof. Obar's grading system and I would like to avoid that.  Thanks. -  • Talk • Coor.

You are presupposing that Asparagaceae (or perhaps """"Asparagaceae"""") is defined under the ICN. The code, however, claims merely to regulate nomenclature, providing definitions only of words like """"cultivar"""" (in Appendix VII), words that do not name taxa. Even if you can produce a reliable source for your claim that names are defined in terms of a type and a rank (a claim that is also made in the lead), you have a problem with neutrality; Monsch (2003), for example, argues that names do not have definitions.

A little history on this article. Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category """"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)"""" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a """"specialist"""" would understand what type of saddle a """"kura"""" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category """"Saddles by type"""" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a """"Kura"""" was, with the word """"Japanese"""" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a """"Kura"""" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.
I have seen """"precision"""" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled """"Precision and disambiguation"""", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article """"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle?

WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title """"Kura (saddle) not """"precise"""" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the """"general reader"""", I would rather have the article named """"Japanese saddle"""" than """"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the """"general reader"""" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).

Compressing the surface gives a pi_1-injective surface, so the 3-manifold group contains a surface subgroup, which can't be the case if it's the integers (since the sphere is excluded).

Actually, the conclusion that the manifold fibers implies that the group contains a surface subgroup.  The surface can't be a sphere (because of irreducibility), so we have a more complicated surface whose fundamental group injects into the fundamental group of the 3-manifold.",0
